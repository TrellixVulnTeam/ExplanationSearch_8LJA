TITLE : Effect of backpack position on foot weight distribution of school-aged children ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] In the present study , we aimed to determine the effects of backpack position on foot weight distribution of standing school-aged children .
[ Subjects ] Thirty school-aged children volunteered to participate in this study .
[ Methods ]
The subjects randomly performed four types of carrying a backpack : no backpack ( condition-1 ) , carrying a backpack at C7 ( condition-2 ) , carrying a backpack at 10 cm below C7 ( condition-3 ) , and carrying a backpack at 20 cm below C7 ( condition-4 ) .
[ Results ] Statistically significant differences were noted in the anterior and posterior pressure values , and in the anterior-to-posterior ratio , among the four conditions ( p < 0.05 ) .
Post-hoc analysis indicated that the pressure value of condition-4 was significantly lower in the anterior foot region and higher in the posterior foot region than in condition-2 and condition-3 .
In addition , the anterior-to-posterior ratio was lower in condition-4 than in condition-2 and condition-3 .
[ Conclusion ]
These findings suggest that carrying a backpack in a higher position , with fastening of the shoulder strap , may be more favorable for normalizing the foot weight distribution .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Backpacks are indispensable , as people regularly use them for a long time to carry objects that are used daily1 ) .
Therefore , avoidance of postural aberration , by practicing appropriate backpack usage , is vital .
Recently , it has been suggested that the prolonged use of backpacks by school-aged children aggravates musculoskeletal conditions2 , 3 ) .
In particular , the increased prevalence of spinal deformities , such as scoliosis and kyphosis , and/or pain and discomfort including low back pain and shoulder pain , may be associated with backpack-carrying habits and the backpack weight4,5,6 ) .
Occasionally , poor distribution of backpack weight and ineffective absorption of this load leads to postural changes , leading to musculoskeletal impairments3 ) .
Hence , school-aged children should be educated and made aware of these concerns to protect their spinal health7 ) .
To our knowledge , although the use of backpacks has a major influence on the spinal condition of school-aged children , the majority of studies have focused on the effects of backpack carrying on posture and movement during standing and walking of adults8 , 9 ) .
Due to this lack of research on juvenile subjects , it is challenging to establish a resource for educating children on the manner in which their backpacks should be correctly used .
Hence , we sought to determine the effects of backpack use on children rather than review the outcomes of existing adult studies .
Thus , we aimed to assess the effects of backpack position on the foot weight distribution of standing school-aged children .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Thirty healthy children ( 14 males , 16 females ) volunteered to participate in this study .
The mean age of the children was 8.43 ± 0.50 years , their mean height was 128.57 ± 6.06 cm , and their mean weight was 30.53 ± 4.17 kg .
Only the subjects who fulfilled the following criteria were included in this study : no orthopedic , neurological , or cognitive impairments that could have influenced the study procedure or results ; no discrepancy in leg length ; and no regular daily exercise .
All subjects signed a written consent form before study participation , and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Cheongju University .
Foot weight distribution during standing was recorded using a force plate ( FDM-s system , Zebris , Germany ) .
This consists of a square plate ( 1.5 m × 1.5 m ) containing 17,000 micro-sensors which detect foot pressure .
A cable connects the force plate to the main unit , and a computer system with custom computer software for analyzing the measured data .
The equipment evaluates the weight pressure distribution of the foot , and analyzes the load distribution of the anterior and posterior foot regions .
We also calculated the anterior-to-posterior load ratio .
Subjects were asked to stand still on the plate , with their feet shoulder length apart and their arms at sides , while looking at a round target attached to wall located 2 m in front of them .
After zero-point calibration , measurement was performed for 1 min and data were averaged over three trials separated by 1 min rest intervals .
Based on the study of Oh and Choi10 ) , four types of backpack ( height : 34 cm , width : 25 cm , and depth : 13 cm ) ( BP-X031 , PROSPECS , Republic of Korea ) carrying conditions were studied .
The backpack position was adjusted using the shoulder strap of the backpack : condition-1 , no backpack ; condition-2 , carrying a backpack at C7 ; condition-3 , carrying a backpack at 10 cm below C7 ; and condition-4 , carrying a backpack at 20 cm below C7 .
The sequence of the four conditions was randomly determined to avoid an interaction effect of each condition .
The randomization process involved blindly drawing a card from an envelope , containing 4 cards marked 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 .
We adjusted the weight of each backpack to 15 % of the subject 's bodyweight ( average backpack weight of the subjects : 4.58±0.63 ) , based on a suggestion made by Al-Khabbaz et al.2 ) , who investigated the effects of backpack weight load .
SPSS 12.0 was used to analyze all data .
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) .
One-way repeated analysis of variance was used for data analysis .
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p<0.05 .
When statistical significance was identified , the differences in the pairwise comparison were examined using the post-hoc Bonferroni adjustment .

Statistically significant differences were noted in the anterior and posterior pressure values , as well as the anterior-to-posterior ratio among the four conditions ( p < 0.05 ) .
Post-hoc analysis indicated that the pressure values of condition-4 were significantly lower in the anterior foot region and higher in the posterior foot region than in condition-2 and condition-3 .
In addition , the anterior-to-posterior ratio was lower in condition-4 than in condition-2 and condition-3 .
BODY.DISCUSSION : The excess weight load of a backpack causes asymmetry in the anterior and posterior load distribution , eliciting forward leaning of the upper trunk to adapt postural agitation and maintain postural balance8 ) .
Although the anterior-to-posterior pressure ratios did not significantly differ among the conditions , the ratios of condition-2 and condition-3 were greater than those of condition-1 , implying that the weight load was greater in the anterior foot region and less in the posterior region .
In condition-3 , weight load appeared to be concentrated to a greater extent on the posterior , rather than the anterior foot region .
A lower backpack position results in the increase of the moment arm generated by the upper trunk movement axis .
Therefore , it may be difficult to maintain the appropriate pressure ratio on the anterior and posterior foot regions .
Similar effects have been observed with increased backpack weight , indicating that carrying a backpack at a higher position , with fastening of the shoulder strap , may be better for normalizing foot weight distribution than other conditions .
Our results are supported by the study performed by Gong et al8 ) .
Previous studies have reported that forward leaning of the upper trunk increases to a greater extent , when subjects carry a backpack in a lower position , with a longer shoulder strap10 , 11 ) .
These studies indicated that the weight load is concentrated on the anterior foot region , which is inconsistent with our present study 's findings .
However , those studies examined walking of subjects , not standing of subjects , as in the present study .
Given that additional load from a backpack can impede forward movement of the body during walking , forward trunk leaning may be an effective strategy for reducing energy consumption10 , 11 ) .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when comparing our results with those of these previous studies , as their results require the understanding of the dynamic walking mechanism rather than that of static control that is behind the present study 's findings .
We believe that carrying a backpack in the upper position may lead to safer use of the backpack , and may help prevent musculoskeletal discomfort in those who regularly use a backpack .
Our findings suggest that adjusting the backpack position , by fastening the shoulder strap , is a useful strategy for the prevention of musculoskeletal problems in school-aged children .
This study had certain limitations , which should be addressed in further research .
First , as the subjects of the present study included only school-aged children , the findings can not be generalized to other age groups .
Second , we did not record long-term follow-up data and the findings may not reflect long-term backpack use .
Finally , the lack of other measures such as electromyography or kinematic analysis may be factors limiting the establishment of a more definite conclusion on the effects of backpack position .
