TITLE : Effects of Computer-based Stress Management Training on Psychological Well-being and Work Performance in Japanese Employees : A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial ABSTRACT : This study evaluated the effectiveness of a computer-based stress management training ( SMT ) program in improving employees ' psychological well-being and work performance .
A total of 12 work units ( N=263 ) were randomly assigned to either an intervention group ( 8 work units , n=142 ) or to a wait-list control group ( 4 work units , n=121 ) .
All participants were requested to answer online questionnaires assessing psychological well-being as a primary outcome , and coping style , social support , and knowledge about stress management as secondary outcomes at baseline ( T0 ) , immediately after the intervention ( T1 ) , and 2 months after the intervention ( T2 ) .
The group × time interaction was tested using a mixed-model repeated measures ANOVA .
Results showed a group × time interaction for " knowledge about stress management " in the entire sample .
Among participants who had more than 3 d of training , a significant group × time interaction was observed for " problem-solving " and " avoidance and suppression " as well as " knowledge about stress management .
"
Our computer-based stress management program was effective for improving knowledge about stress management .
It was also effective for improving coping skills in instances where participants had enough time ( at least 3 d ) to complete all sessions .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Stress management training ( SMT ) is provided as a psychoeducational program to enable individual workers to learn how to become aware of and develop effective skills to cope with stress1 ) .
Several SMT techniques are used in work settings , such as cognitive-behavioral training , personalized feedback based on systematic assessment , relaxation training , physical fitness training , and various combinations of these approaches2,3,4 ) .
A recent meta-analysis of SMT has shown that cognitive-behavioral techniques are more effective than other techniques for enhancing psychological resources and reducing the psychological distress of employees3 , 5 ) .
Cognitive-behavioral techniques , such as cognitive restructuring skills , social skills , and problem-solving skills , are explicitly aimed at enhancing individual coping skills6 ) .
Coping refers to cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person7 ) .
Previous studies suggest that SMT programs with cognitive-behavioral techniques were effective for improving coping skills8,9,10 ) .
In addition to coping skills , interpersonal relationships ( i.e. , social support , or lack thereof , and interpersonal problems ) have been found to be critical in determining employees ' psychological distress .
For instance , social support helps an employee exert situational control through the provision of instrumental aid or advice about how to modify a situation to make it less stressful7 ) .
Furthermore , the workplace community is one of the factors that contributes to reducing employee burnout rates11 ) .
Lack of social support may lead to increased psychological distress .
In Japan , 45.8 % of employees indicated that interpersonal problems are their primary stressor12 ) .
This suggests that it is important that SMT programs should focus not only on improving behavioral and cognitive coping skills , but also interpersonal relationships ( e.g. , increasing social support ) .
Notably , in the current research , we examined the effects of our intervention on both the negative ( i.e. , psychological distress ) and positive aspects of psychological well-being ( i.e. , work engagement , job satisfaction , and work performance ) .
Psychology has recently been criticized as primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental " well-being " .
Since the turn of the century , however , a new trend toward " positive psychology " has emerged .
Positive psychology focuses on human strengths and optimal functioning rather than on weakness and malfunctioning13 ) .
This shift found in mainstream psychology is also relevant for occupational health psychology .
In recent years , results of SMT programs included not only negative outcomes , such as depression , psychological distress , and anxiety5 , 14 ) , but also positive outcomes such as job satisfaction15 , 16 ) , work performance17 , 18 ) , vitality19 ) , and propensity to innovate16 ) .
Although empirical evidence that supports the effectiveness of individual-focused SMT is accumulating , the workplace still has a number of barriers that impede access to mental health activities , such as " lack of experts " and " lack of knowledge about how to address mental health services"12 ) .
Computer-based self-help programs may be an effective and inexpensive alternative to traditional face-to-face SMT programs .
For instance , Shimazu et al.20 ) investigated the effectiveness of a computer-based psychoeducational program for workers .
They found that participants in the intervention group experienced improvements in self-efficacy and job satisfaction .
Another study by Eisen et al.21 ) investigating the relative effectiveness of a live versus computer guidance group , showed that the computer guidance group was similar to the live guidance group in terms of the frequency with which participants practiced their skills21 ) .
Furthermore , computer-based self-help programs can be used as tools to compensate for the lack of experts and knowledge in the workplace on how to address mental health services among occupational health staff .
However , few studies have investigated the positive aspects of computer-based SMT program outcomes using rigorous study designs such as a randomized controlled trial .
The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-based SMT program and evaluate its effectiveness on employees ' psychological well-being ( i.e. , ( lower ) psychological distress , work engagement , and job satisfaction ) , and work performance .
We hypothesized that our computer-based SMT program would improve employees ' psychological resources ( i.e. , coping skills , social support , and knowledge about stress management as secondary outcomes ) and consequently their psychological well-being ( i.e. , ( lower ) psychological distress , work engagement , and job satisfaction ) and work performance .
BODY.METHODS.PARTICIPANTS : This study was conducted as a mental health promotion program in a manufacturing company .
In total , 12 work units from the research and development divisions and support staff ( N=266 ) were invited to participate in the study .
All participants were full-time employees .
Participants were informed about the program by an informational poster as well as their supervisor during meetings .
Participants were randomly assigned by work unit22 ) to either an intervention or wait-list control group to participate in a computer-based SMT program .
No inclusion or exclusion criteria were adopted because the intervention was planned for all employees in the research and development divisions .
All employees participated , with the exception of one individual who was responsible for coordinating study-related details between the company and the author of this paper and another who changed workplaces prior to completing the baseline survey .
BODY.METHODS.DESIGN : The study was a cluster randomized controlled trial .
In May 2009 , a baseline survey ( T0 ) was conducted , and then participants were randomly assigned by work unit to a computer-based intervention group ( 8 work units , n=142 ) or a wait-list control group ( 4 work units , n=121 ) .
Additionally , participants were required to answer online questionnaires at 9 weeks ( T1 ) and 19 weeks ( T2 ) after the baseline survey .
The timing of these questionnaires were selected based on recommendations in a meta-analysis conducted by van der Klink5 ) .
Specifically , van der Klink recommends a minimum of 12 weeks between baseline surveys and follow-up questionnaires since health outcomes are more stable than coping skills8 ) .
The intervention group started the 7-week program immediately after the baseline survey , while the wait-list control group started after the T2 follow-up survey .
BODY.METHODS.INTERVENTION PROGRAM : A computer-based SMT program was developed using the following 3 steps : 1 ) literature review , 2 ) trial survey , and 3 ) modification .
First , a trial program was developed based on results from past stress management training research18 ) .
Next , a pilot trial , consisting of 19 employees who worked in laboratory or administration department , was conducted at a research institute in September 2008 .
Lastly , after implementing revisions based on participants ' feedback ( n=11 ) , the final version of the program was completed .
The computer-based SMT program was self-paced and consisted of the following : 1 ) behavioral techniques , 2 ) communication techniques , and 3 ) cognitive techniques .
Additionally , each part was divided into 2 topics on the basis of cognitive behavioral skills : ( a ) problem-solving and time management skills for the behavioral techniques section , ( b ) assertion and delegation skills for the communication techniques section , and ( c ) cognitive restructuring and causal attribution skills for the cognitive techniques section .
Participants learned these skills in a 2-phased approach , which consisted of a skill acquisition phase and a practice phase .
The skill acquisition phase focused on improving participants ' understanding of each skill .
Through self-monitoring , participants learned which skills they lacked .
The practice phase focused on encouraging participants to put the skills they acquired to practice in their everyday life .
Participants could enter any problems or experiences they encountered on their own private web page to help resolve them .
According to social learning theory , self-efficacy beliefs ( judgments regarding one 's capabilities ) and outcome expectancies ( judgments regarding the consequences of behaviors ) significantly influence coping behaviors23 ) .
The goal of the skill acquisition phase was to increase participants ' ' outcome expectancies ' about intervention related outcomes , and the goal of the practice phase was to increase ' efficacy expectancy ' .
BODY.METHODS.LEARNING PROCEDURE : One of the office staff served as the coordinator between the participants and author of the present work .
Participants in both groups were given individual IDs and passwords before starting the program .
Participants underwent the program during working hours .
Communication between participants and the author took place entirely through e-mail without any face-to-face interaction .
Considering that the average length of the stress management intervention program was 7.4 weeks14 ) and that our program consisted of six lessons , an optimal pace of one lesson per week was chosen .
Hence , participants received an email every week during the time course of the intervention .
To increase participants ' motivation and decrease dropout rates , the following 3 types of e-mails served as reminders or prompts : 1 ) an " encouragement e-mail " for participants who had not finished all 6 topics , 2 ) a " congratulations e-mail " for participants who finished all topics for the first time , and 3 ) an " application enhancement e-mail " for participants who finished all topics and were ready for skills phase .
These e-mails were sent to participants through the coordinator every week throughout the intervention .
BODY.METHODS.MEASUREMENTS : All data were assessed using self-report questionnaires , and all questionnaires were administered on the internet .
Questionnaires , as well as the learning program , were only accessible with an ID and password .
Details of the scales and questions used in the study are described below .
BODY.METHODS.MEASUREMENTS.PRIMARY OUTCOMES : Psychological distress was assessed using the 18-item Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ)24 ) measuring the extent to which participants experienced irritability-anger , fatigue ( e.g. , " I am completely tired " ) , anxiety ( e.g. , " I feel ill at ease " ) , depression ( e.g. , " I feel depressed " ) , and lack of vigor in the four weeks prior .
Items were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 4 ( strongly agree ) .
Higher scores indicated greater psychological distress .
Job satisfaction was assessed using a single item of the BJSQ24 ) assessing the extent to which participants were satisfied with their job .
This item was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 ( dissatisfied ) to 4 ( satisfied ) .
Higher scores indicated greater job satisfaction .
Work engagement was assessed using the short form of the Japanese version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-J)25 ) .
The UWES-J consists of 3 subscales with 9 items ( i.e. , vigor , dedication , absorption ) .
Items were scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 ( never ) to 6 ( always ) .
Item examples were " At my job , I feel strong and vigorous " ( vigor ) , " I am enthusiastic about my job " ( dedication ) , and " I am immersed in my work " ( absorption ) .
A total score was calculated using all 9 items .
Higher scores indicated greater work engagement .
Work performance was assessed using the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ)26 , 27 ) .
The HPQ includes items assessing the following : quantitative and qualitative work efficiency over the previous 30 d ( 10 items ) , self-evaluated job outcomes relative to other workers ( 1 item ) , and special work success or failure over the past 30 d ( 2 items ) .
Due to the space limitation , one item was removed from the HPQ ( i.e. , self-evaluated job outcomes relative to those of other workers ) .
Participants were also asked to rate their overall work performance over the past 4 weeks .
This item was scored using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 ( worst possible performance ) to 10 ( best possible performance ) .
Higher scores indicated greater perceived work performance .
BODY.METHODS.MEASUREMENTS.SECONDARY OUTCOMES : Coping skills were assessed using a subscale taken from the Brief Scales for Coping Profile (BSCP)28 ) .
The BSCP consists of 6 subscales containing 18 items ( i.e. , active solution , seeking help for solution , changing mood , emotional expression involving others , avoidance and suppression , and changing point of view ) .
Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they used a particular strategy for coping with stressful workplace situations using a scale that ranged from 1 ( almost never ) to 4 ( very often ) .
The current study used an " active solution " scale for problem solving and a " seeking help for solution " scale for seeking social support .
Examples were " I try to analyze the cause and solve the problem " ( problem solving ) , " I try to solve the problem by talking to those involved in the matter " ( seeking social support ) , " I try to do something that calms me down " ( changing mood ) , " I complain to people who have nothing to do with the problem " ( emotional expression involving others ) , " I do nothing but endure the situation because I do n't know what to do " ( avoidance and suppression ) , and " I try to look at only the positive aspects of the situation " ( changing a point of view ) .
Higher scores reflected more frequent use of the indicated coping strategy .
Social support was assessed using 6 items of the BJSQ24 ) .
Items were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 ( disagree ) to 4 ( agree ) .
Three items were used to assess social support from participants ' supervisors and another three items assessed social support from coworkers ( e.g. , " How much is each of the following people willing to listen to your personal problems ?
" ) .
Higher scores indicated greater support .
Knowledge about how to cope with stress was assessed using 6 questions on the following topics : ( a ) problem-solving skills , ( b ) time management skills , ( c ) assertion skills , ( d ) delegation skills , ( e ) cognitive restructuring skills , and ( f ) causal attribution skills .
Participants were asked to choose the most suitable option among 4 skills presented .
A score of 1 was given for a correct answer .
To assess the reliability and validity of this measurement , 2 analyses were conducted .
First , using T0 and T1 scores from the wait-list control group , a weighted kappa statistic was calculated ( K=0.49 ) .
Next , the correlation between " the minimum number of days participants log onto a website to study the contents " and " knowledge about stress management " was assessed for the intervention group ( T0 to T1 r=0.13 , p>0.05 ; T0 to T2 r=0.16 , p=0.06 ) .
BODY.METHODS.MEASUREMENTS.COVARIATES : Job demands were assessed by using 3-item subscales of the BJSQ24 ) .
Items were scored on a 4-point self-anchoring scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 4 ( strongly agree ) .
An item example was " My job requires working hard .
" High scale scores indicated a high extent of Job demands .
BODY.METHODS.MEASUREMENTS.DEMOGRAPHIC DATA : Demographic data such as sex , age , and job position were also collected using the questionnaire .
BODY.METHODS.SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION : The statistical power analysis was conducted using the G*Power 3 program29 ) .
We calculated sample size with a method that takes into account the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC)30 ) .
We assumed an intracluster correlation of ρ=0.2 , 15 participants for each unit .
To prove an intervention effect with an effect size of Cohen 's d=0.4 ( we decided effect size from our previous study18 ) ) and with an error probability α=0.05 and 80 % power , n=128 people in each study arm were required for analysis .
BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL ANALYSES : All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 18.0 J. Baseline characteristics of the intervention and wait-list control groups were compared and tested using t-tests for continuous data comparisons and χ2 tests for ordinal or categorical data comparisons .
Furthermore , using the T0 data from the intervention group , we also compared baseline characteristics between " completers " , or participants who completed all six contents and answered all T0 , T1 and T2 questionnaires , and " non-completers " , or participants who answered the T0 questionnaire but ( 1 ) did not complete all the contents and ( 2 ) did not answer the T1 and/or T2 questionnaires .
To assess the effects of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes , a group × time interaction was tested using a mixed-model approach employing a repeated-measures ANOVA and the restricted maximum likelihood ( REML ) estimation method .
We included time and group as fixed factors and subject as a nested within unit random factor .
The within-subjects factor was " time " and the between-subjects factor was " group " .
Job demands were included in the model as a covariate .
When the group × time interaction was interpreted as significant , time simple main effect was computed for each group .
In addition , paired t-test for T0 to T1 and T0 to T2 were used to test the differences .
The effect size ( Cohen 's d ) was also calculated as a standardized measure of change31 ) .
Cohen suggested the values of d equal to 0.20 , 0.50 , and 0.80 as small , medium , and large effect sizes , respectively .
Since multiple comparisons were made , the Bonferroni correction was applied to control for increased probability of Type 1 errors or spurious results .
Using the Bonferroni procedure , statistical significance was reduced from 0.05 to 0.0038 ( 0.05/13 ) .
We conducted additional analyses .
First , we assessed intervention effects excluding participants in the " dashed study group , " which referred to participants that ( 1 ) did not finished all 6 topics , ( 2 ) had finished the program in one day , or ( 3 ) had joined the program 2 d before the study deadline .
Even though our program allows for a short learning time ( 1 topic per approximately 30 min ) , one or two days was not enough time to finish our computer-based SMT program during working hours .
It is important to note that participants in the intervention group were divided into two groups by the median number of days they spent studying .
Secondly , we conducted the sub-group analysis according to the level of psychological distress at T0 .
In this sub-group analysis , participants were divided into one of two groups using a median split .
Using this approach we examined whether psychological distress moderated the effects of the intervention .
We performed this analysis because past work32 ) has suggested that the effects of an SMT program are more prominent among employees experiencing high psychological distress .
BODY.METHODS.ETHICS : The study procedure was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board of the University of Tokyo , Graduate School of Medicine .
BODY.RESULTS.PARTICIPANT FLOW : A summary of participant flow and retention is shown in Fig. 1Fig .
1.Enrollment , random assignment , and follow-up of the participants ..
A total of 266 participants were invited to participate in the study and 263 participants were met eligibility requirements and included in the analysis .
Of the 142 employees in the intervention group , 127 participants ( 89 % ) completed all 6 topics , and 16 employees ( 11 % ) did not finish it .
Of the 16 employees , 1 employee discontinued the program because he/she retired during the course of the study .
The remaining 15 employees did not specify the reason they did not complete the program .
One hundred and sixteen participants who completed all six contents and answered all measures at T0 , T1 and T2 .
One hundred and thirteen ( 80 % ) participants in the intervention group first learned problem solving skills and then time management skills .

Although the intervention group had significantly higher scores on work engagement compared to the wait-list control group ( t=−2.2 , p=0.00 ) , no other significant differences were found between the groups ( p>0.05 ) .
BODY.RESULTS.DROPOUT ANALYSIS : Baseline characteristics between completers ( n=116 ) and non-completers ( n=26 ) in the intervention group were compared .
Non-completers had significantly higher psychological distress scores ( t=2.04 , p=0.043 ) and lower scores for seeking social support ( t=−2.63 , p=0.009 ) and changing a point of view compared to completers ( t=−2.70 , p=0.008 ) .
However , we detected no differences between the groups in any of the other variables ( p>0.05 ) .

‡ Intervention group ( n=85 ) § Wait-list control group ( n=121 ) .
A repeated-measures mixed-model ANOVA revealed a statistically significant group × time interaction on knowledge about stress management ( F=6.028 , p=0.003 ) .
The simple main effect of time on knowledge was significant for both the intervention and wait-list control groups ( F=7.785 , p=0.001 ; F=4.003 , p=0.020 , respectively ) .
Knowledge scores significantly increased from T0 to T1 in intervention group ( p<0.001 ) and significantly decreased from T0 to T2 in the wait-list control group ( p=0.023 ) .
However , there was no significant group × time interaction on any of the other variables assessed ( p>0.05 ) .
It is important to note that we found small effects of the intervention on measures of work performance ( T1 , T2 ) , job satisfaction ( T1 , T2 ) , problem-solving ( T1 , T2 ) , seeking social support ( T1 , T2 ) , avoidance and suppression ( T2 ) , changing a point of view ( T2 ) , supervisor support ( T1 , T2 ) , and coworker support ( T2 ) .
However , these effects were not statistically significant .
BODY.RESULTS.EFFECTS OF THE INTERVENTION.ADDITIONAL ANALYSES : In the intervention group , 40 % of participants were met requirements for the " dashed study group " .
We assessed intervention effects excluding participants in the " dashed study group " .
In this analysis , there was no significant group × time interaction on the primary outcome measures ( p>0.05 ) .
However , a repeated-measures mixed-model ANOVA revealed a group × time interaction on secondary outcome measures .
Specifically , there was a significant group × time interaction for " problem-solving " , " avoidance and suppression " , and " knowledge about stress management " ( F=5.029 , p=0.007 ; F=3.171 , p=0.043 ; F=7.819 , p<0.001 , respectively ) .
Furthermore , there was a marginally significant group × time interaction for " seeking social support " ( F=2.784 , p=0.063 ) .
However , there was no significant group × time interaction for any other secondary outcomes ( p>0.05 ) .
The simple main effects of time on " problem-solving " and " seeking social support " were statistically significant ( F=9.668 , p<0.001 ; F=6.273 , p=0.002 , respectively ) for the intervention group only .
For the intervention group , " problem-solving " and " seeking social support " scores significantly increased from T0 to T1 ( p=0.002 ; p<0.001 , respectively ) and from T0 to T2 ( p=0.004 ; p=0.007 , respectively ) .
The simple main effect of time on " avoidance and suppression " was marginally significant ( F=2.520 , p=0.083 , respectively ) for the wait-list control group .

Next , we conducted a sub-group analysis according to level of psychological distress at T0 .
Among participants with low initial psychological distress levels , a repeated-measures mixed-model ANOVA revealed a significant group × time interaction on " knowledge about stress management " ( F=5.186 , p=0.006 ) .
However , results did not show a significant group × time interaction on any other variables ( p>0.05 ) .
The simple main effect of time on " knowledge about stress management " was statistically significant for both the intervention and wait-list control groups ( F=4.698 , p=0.011 ; F=8.789 , p<0.001 , respectively ) .
Knowledge scores significantly increased from T0 to T1 among participants in the intervention group ( p=0.008 ) and significantly decreased from T0 to T2 among participants in the wait-list control group ( p<0.001 ) .
In contrast , among participants with high initial psychological distress levels , a repeated-measures mixed-model ANOVA revealed a marginally significant group × time interaction on " seeking social support " ( F=2.863 , p=0.059 ) .
However , there was no group × time interaction on any other variables ( p>0.05 ) .
The simple main effect of time on " seeking social support " was significant for the intervention group ( F=5.459 , p=0.005 ) .
For participants in the intervention group , " seeking social support " scores significantly increased from T0 to T1 ( p=0.019 ) and T0 to T2 ( p=0.006 ) .
BODY.DISCUSSION : The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-based SMT program and to evaluate its effectiveness on employees ' psychological resources and well-being .
We used a cluster randomization design that assigned employees to intervention and control groups by work unit .
One advantage of this design was that it prevented participants from finding out about the contents of the program33 ) .
If individual allocation had been used for this study , participants in the control group might have been affected by interactions with their colleagues in the intervention group .
Furthermore , in contrast to previous interventions , which have typically focused on a single topic20 , 34,35,36 ) , the current work employed a computer-based SMT program that assessed a wider variety of topics on stress management skills .
The completion rate , or the ratio of participants who completed the whole program , was higher in the current research ( 89 and 92 % for the intervention and wait-list control groups , respectively ) compared to previous studies (76–86%)20 , 34 , 37 ) .
In addition , a manager in the intervention group requested permission to use the materials for future management training of his subordinates .
These results suggest that the contents and procedures used in the current intervention were accepted by the participants .
Dropout analyses revealed that employees with high initial levels of " psychological distress " tended to drop out throughout the study .
This result is in line with previous research showing that stressed employees are more likely to drop out than their non-stressed counterparts32 ) .
Contrary to our expectations , we found a favorable effect of the intervention only on " knowledge about stress management " at T1 but not on any other primary or secondary outcomes at T1 and T2 .
In our study , 40 % of participants ( i.e. , dashed study group ) finished the program in 1 or 2 d , and almost all of them accessed the program 2 d before the deadline for the first time .
This suggests that they did not have enough time to incorporate their newly acquired knowledge and skills into their everyday life .
Previous research has shown that more frequent use of stress-reduction skills are significantly correlated with greater improvements in stress related outcomes21 ) .
Hence , more time would have been necessary for participants to show improvements on all other outcomes variables except for knowledge .
This explanation is bolstered by the finding that the intervention produced favorable effects not only on participants ' knowledge but also on coping skills ( i.e. , problem-solving , and seeking social support ) at T1 and T2 ( when excluding data from the dashed-study group ) .
More frequent use of problem-solving and support-seeking skills in participants ' daily lives may have led to these improvements .
Nevertheless , it should be noted that , while not statistically significant , our program had small effects on outcome variables ( i.e. , work performance , job satisfaction , problem-solving , seeking social support , and supervisor support ) .
It was hypothesized that the intervention would improve participants ' self-efficacy ; however , our findings suggest that in spite of the intervention , participants were not able to incorporate their newly learned skills into the work setting .
This failure may , in turn , have caused a reduction of self-efficacy .
As such , the practical phase of this intervention may benefit from more intensive follow-up sessions aimed at teaching participants how to apply their newly learned skills to work setting scenarios .
Despite the methodological rigor of the present study , there are five limitations that should be addressed in future research .
The first limitation has to do with the sample characteristics .
Specifically , all participants in the study were employees at a manufacturing company , most of whom were men .
Therefore , this population is not representative of the general working population .
The second limitation is that our computer-based SMT program consisted of 6 topics , but we did not examine the effect of order on any outcome measures .
Future research is needed to clarify whether there is an effect of order on program learning .
The third limitation is that outcome measures were only assessed via self-report .
Self-reported data could increase the problem of common method variance .
Objective indicators on physical health ( e.g. , urinary cortisol , salivary cortisol , blood pressure , heart rate ) and work performance ( e.g. , personnel evaluation ) should also be assessed in future work .
The fourth limitation is that no specific indications of how long it took for the intervention effect to appear or disappear were found .
Although there is some evidence showing that without booster sessions , the effectiveness of similar interventions diminishes after 6 months38 ) , more research is still needed .
The fifth limitation pertains to the clinical/practical significance of the current research findings .
Specifically , the observed changes between baseline and the follow-up sessions for the control and intervention groups are unclear due to lack of previous evidence and quantitative information .
Additional studies on the effects of web-based psychoeducation are needed to assess the clinical/practical significance of the effect of this kind of intervention on changes in the outcomes of interest .
In conclusion , the computer-based stress management program was effective in improving knowledge about stress management .
Among participants that had enough time ( at least 3 d ) to complete all training sessions , the intervention was also effective at improving coping skills .
