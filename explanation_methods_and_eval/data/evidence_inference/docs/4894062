TITLE : Modulation of gut microbiota dysbioses in type 2 diabetic patients by macrobiotic Ma-Pi 2 diet ABSTRACT : The gut microbiota exerts a role in type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , and deviations from a mutualistic ecosystem layout are considered a key environmental factor contributing to the disease .
Thus , the possibility of improving metabolic control in T2D by correcting gut microbiome dysbioses through diet has been evaluated .
Here , we explore the potential of two different energy-restricted dietary approaches – the fibre-rich macrobiotic Ma-Pi 2 diet or a control diet recommended by Italian professional societies for T2D treatment – to correct gut microbiota dysbioses in T2D patients .
In a previous 21-d open-label MADIAB trial , fifty-six overweight T2D patients were randomised to the Ma-Pi 2 or the control diet .
For the present study , stools were collected before and after intervention from a subset of forty MADIAB participants , allowing us to characterise the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing and imputed metagenomics .
To highlight microbiota dysbioses in T2D , the gut microbiota of thirteen normal-weight healthy controls were characterised .
According to our findings , both diets were effective in modulating gut microbiome dysbioses in T2D , resulting in an increase of the ecosystem diversity and supporting the recovery of a balanced community of health-promoting SCFA producers , such as Faecalibacterium , Roseburia , Lachnospira , Bacteroides and Akkermansia .
The Ma-Pi 2 diet , but not the control diet , was also effective in counteracting the increase of possible pro-inflammatory groups , such as Collinsella and Streptococcus , in the gut ecosystem , showing the potential to reverse pro-inflammatory dysbioses in T2D , and possibly explaining the greater efficacy in improving the metabolic control .
BODY : Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is markedly increasing its prevalence in Westernised countries ( 1 ) , and it represents a challenging problem for national healthcare systems ( 2 ) .
Recent insights provided evidence of an altered gut microbiota ( GM ) in T2D subjects , suggesting a possible role for gut micro-organisms in the disease onset ( 3 – 7 ) .
Intestinal micro-organisms , and their metabolic products , have been shown to exert relevant functions in regulating host metabolic pathways ( 8 ) .
Indeed , GM components can modulate different factors contributing to the host metabolic phenotype , such as intestinal gluconeogenesis , insulin sensitivity , lipid accumulation and glucose control ( 9 , 10 ) .
Although a mutualistic GM composition is crucial to support the host energy homeostasis , certain GM dysbioses can result in profound deregulations of the host metabolism , supporting the onset and consolidation of metabolic diseases , such as T2D ( 11 , 12 ) .
Moreover , a pro-inflammatory layout of the gut microbial ecosystem has been suggested to be the basis of chronic inflammatory processes observed in T2D , and the new concept of metabolic infection has been proposed ( 13 , 14 ) .
As a result of an increased gut permeability , endotoxins from pro-inflammatory GM components can penetrate the epithelial barrier and aggravate metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance in T2D ( 15 ) .
Thus , the GM has the potential to exert a multifactorial role in T2D , and deviations from a health-promoting GM composition could represent a key determinant contributing to the disease onset ( 11 , 16 – 18 ) .
As diet has been recognised as a potent modulator of the composition and metabolism of the human GM ( 19 ) , the possibility to improve metabolic control in T2D by developing selective diets that are able to correct the GM dysbioses has been considered ( 11 , 16 , 20 ) .
Very recently , the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet has been reported to be more effective than a control ( CTR ) diet , which is based on the dietary guidelines recommended by professional societies in Italy , for the improvement of metabolic control in T2D patients ( 21 ) .
Conceived by Mario Pianesi , the Ma-Pi 2 diet is a fibre-rich macrobiotic diet with a prebiotic potential , which is in line with the dietary recommendations of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics ( 22 ) .
Specifically , the Ma-Pi 2 diet is enriched in complex carbohydrates , legumes , fermented products , sea salt and green tea , and it excludes fat and protein from animal source and added sugars .
In a 21-d controlled open-label trial ( MADIAB trial ) , fifty-six overweight T2D patients were randomised ( 1:1 ratio ) to the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet or the CTR diet .
At the end of this short-term nutritional intervention , the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet proved to be more effective in reducing fasting and postprandial blood glucose , glycated Hb ( HbA1c ) , serum cholesterol , homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , BMI and waist and hip circumferences compared with the CTR diet ( 21 ) .
According to the authors , the greater effect of the high-fibre Ma-Pi 2 diet on several metabolic parameters of T2D patients was probably because of , at least in part , an inherent capability of favouring the recovery of a mutualistic GM layout .
To verify this hypothesis , in this study , we specifically compared the efficacy of the Ma-Pi 2 and the CTR diet in modulating GM dysbioses in a subset of forty overweight T2D patients participating in the MADIAB trial , for whom stools were successfully collected before and after intervention .
To this aim , stools were analysed for the microbiota composition by next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) of the 16S rRNA gene and imputed metagenomics .
To provide a picture of the baseline GM dysbioses in the enrolled T2D patients , their microbiota profiles were compared with those of thirteen normal-weight healthy controls .
Our findings suggest that the Ma-Pi 2 diet has the potential to reverse compositional and functional GM dysbioses in T2D , favouring the recovery of a mutualistic configuration capable of supporting the host energy homeostasis .
BODY.METHODS.STUDY DESIGN : The design of the MADIAB trial is described in Soare et al. ( 21 ) .
Briefly , it was designed as a 21-d controlled open-label trial , in which the participants were assigned ( 1:1 ) to the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet or a CTR diet based on the dietary guidelines for T2D recommended by professional societies in Italy .
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines , and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University Campus Bio-Medico ( trial registration number ISRCTN10467793 ; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10467793 ) .
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects/patients .
The Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes of the University Campus Bio-Medico in Rome ( Italy ) recruited overweight or obese ( BMI 27–45 kg/m2 ) subjects , aged 40–77 years and affected by T2D ( Table 1 ) .
Associated metabolic syndrome was evaluated according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria , although it was not an inclusion criterion .
Inclusion criteria were as follows : T2D diagnosed at least 1 year before the start of the trial , treated exclusively with dietary intervention , oral hypoglycaemic drugs or both for 6 months before study entry .
Exclusion criteria were as follows : the use of insulin either at present or at any time in the 2 year before the study , current use of corticosteroid therapy or any other drug that can interfere with carbohydrate metabolism , alcohol abuse and pregnancy .
Subjects who already followed a macrobiotic diet were excluded from the study .
Participants ' eating habits concerning the period antecedent the study start were assessed using qualitative and quantitative questionnaires ( online Supplementary Table S1 ) .
Eligible T2D subjects were divided into two groups according to the diet randomly assigned ( twenty-eight participants were randomised to the Ma-Pi 2 diet and twenty-eight to the CTR diet ) , and they were accommodated in two different hotels , which were located close to each other .
Randomisation was stratified by BMI at baseline and by sex .

Stratified random sampling was used to ensure that the groups contained similar numbers of patients with BMI≥35·0 kg/m2 ( the median in the cohort of eligible patients ) and similar number of male patients .
The menus were designed as a 2-d diet repeated cyclically along the whole duration of the study .
Both diets were energy intake restricted to 7949 kJ ( 1900 kcal ) for men and 7113 kJ ( 1700 kcal ) for women ( online Supplementary Table S2 ) .
In particular , the CTR diet derived energy from 40–60 % carbohydrate , 10–20 % protein , 30 % fat and ≥20 g/4184 kJ ( 1000 kcal ) fibre .
It was adapted to the Mediterranean culinary style .
Vegetables , fruit , cereal , fish and white meat typical of the Mediterranean style were used ; alcohol and sucrose consumption was forbidden .
Diet meal plans and recipes are described in the Additional File 1 of the study by Soare et al. ( 21 ) .
Briefly , daily diet administration was organised in three meals ( breakfast , lunch and dinner ) and two snacks , 2·5 h after breakfast and lunch .
Every participant was informed that a leftover ≥5 % of the total food intake meant the dismissal from the trial .
Participants were asked to keep their exercise habits unvaried during the intervention period , and their physical activity was registered using a pedometer ( Tri-axial activity monitor , XL-18/XL-18 CN-AND ; A&D Medical ) .
Primary outcomes were the change in fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) and postprandial blood glucose ( PPBG ) levels from the baseline ( T0 ) to the 21st day of treatment ( T1 ) .
Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline in plasma concentration of HbA1c , total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol and the LDL : HDL ratio , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , TNF-α and IL-6 , as well as insulin resistance , body weight , BMI , waist and hip circumference and GM composition .
For GM analysis , participants were asked to provide a faecal sample before ( T0 ) and after the 21-d nutritional intervention ( T1 ) .
Stool samples were successfully collected from a subset of forty T2D patients participating in the MADIAB trial aged 50–77 years ( mean age 66 years ) : twenty-one assigned to the Ma-Pi 2 diet and nineteen to the CTR diet .
The gut microbiome study was conducted in this subset of forty MADIAB participants .
In addition , thirteen healthy controls , aged 21–40 years ( mean age 32 years ) and with 18·3–24·6 kg/m2 BMI , were enrolled for the study ( Table 1 ) .
They were asked to provide a faecal sample , and their eating habits were assessed using qualitative and quantitative questionnaires as well ( online Supplementary Table S1 ) .
All samples were immediately frozen at −20 ° C , and then transferred within 1 week to −80 ° C and stored there until processing .
BODY.METHODS.16S : Total microbial DNA was extracted from faeces using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit ( Qiagen ) by introducing three FastPrep ( MP Biomedicals ) bead-beating 1-min steps at 5·5 movements/s , with 5-min incubation in ice between treatments ( 23 ) .
DNA recovery was evaluated using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies ) and 2200 TapeStation instrument ( Agilent Technologies ) .
For each sample , the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR-amplified in 25-μl volumes containing 12·5 ng of microbial DNA , 2 × KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix ( Kapa Biosystems ) and 200 nmol/l of S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21 primers ( 24 ) carrying Illumina overhang adapter sequences ( Bio-Fab Research ) .
Thermal cycle consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 ° C for 3 min , twenty-five cycles of denaturation at 95 ° C for 30 s , annealing at 55 ° C for 30 s , extension at 72 ° C for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 ° C for 5 min .
Amplicons of about 460 bp were purified with a magnetic bead-based clean-up system ( Agencourt AMPure XP ; Beckman Coulter ) and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform using a 2 × 300 bp paired end protocol , according to the manufacturer 's instructions ( Illumina ) .
Briefly , indexed libraries were prepared by limited-cycle PCR using Nextera technology and further cleaned up with AMPure XP magnetic beads ( Beckman Coulter ) .
Libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations , denatured and diluted to 6 pmol/l before loading onto the MiSeq flow cell .
Amplicon sequences were deposited in the MG-RAST database ( http://metagenomics.anl.gov/linkin.cgi?project=17675 ) .
BODY.METHODS.BIOINFORMATICS AND STATISTICS : Raw sequences were processed using a pipeline combining PANDAseq ( paired-end assembler for Illumina sequences ) ( 25 ) and QIIME ( Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology ) ( 26 ) .
High-quality reads were binned into operational taxonomic units ( OTU ) at a 0·97 similarity threshold using UCLUST ( 27 ) .
Taxonomy was assigned using the RDP ( Ribosomal Database Project ) classifier against Greengenes database ( May 2013 release ) .
Chimera filtering was performed by discarding all singleton OTU .
α Rarefaction was analysed by using the Faith 's phylogenetic diversity , Chao1 , observed species and Shannon index metrics .
β Diversity was estimated by computing weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances .
Weighted UniFrac distances were used for principal coordinates analysis ( PCoA ) and plotted by the rgl and vegan packages of R. Data separation in the PCoA was tested using a permutation test with pseudo F ratios ( function adonis in the vegan package ) .
Heat-map analysis was performed using the R ggplot2 package .
Metagenome imputation of Greengenes-picked OTU was performed using PICRUSt ( Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States ) ( 28 ) with default settings .
The KEGG ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ) Orthology ( KO ) database ( 29 ) was used for functional annotation .
Procrustes superimposition was conducted on the normalised KO gene data set and phylogenetic compositional data using vegan and rgl .
The correlation between age and GM diversity was computed by Kendall τ correlation test .
To identify which feature in each diet contributed to the modulation of single bacterial groups , a graphical representation of phylogenetic data and dietary metadata was obtained using GraPhlAn ( 30 ) .
All statistical analyses were performed in R , version 3.1.3 .
Significant differences were assessed by Wilcoxon 's signed rank-sum test .
When appropriate , a paired test was used .
Where necessary , P values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini – Hochberg method .
P<0·05 was considered statistically significant .
Statistical analysis of the primary and other secondary outcomes from the subset of forty MADIAB participants who provided stool samples was carried out as reported by Soare et al. ( 21 ) .
Briefly , quantitative variables were summarised using percentiles , and the comparison between time points and dietary groups was performed using the Wilcoxon 's signed rank-sum test .
BODY.RESULTS.COMPARISON OF THE GUT MICROBIOTA COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURE BETWEEN OVERWEIGHT TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS AND HEALTHY CONTROLS : The phylogenetic structure of the GM ecosystem of forty overweight T2D patients before ( T0 ) and after ( T1 ) nutritional intervention , and thirteen normal-weight healthy adults , was characterised by NGS of the V3–V4 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA ( rDNA ) ( online Supplementary Fig. S1 ) .
A total of 3 198 509 high-quality reads were obtained , with a mean of 30 277 ( sd 4850 ) reads per sample .
Reads were clustered in 30 874 OTU at 97 % identity .
Rarefaction curves obtained with Shannon , Chao1 , PD ( phylogenetic diversity ) whole tree and observed species phylogenetic metrics approximated the saturation level after 3300 reads ( online Supplementary Fig. S1 ) .
To characterise GM dysbioses in T2D at the enrolment , the compositional structure of the GM at T0 was compared with that of healthy controls .
In the online Supplementary Table S1 , we provide the dietary behaviours during the 6 months before the trial for all T2D patients , as well as the dietary habits of the healthy controls .
T2D patients were characterised by a significant reduction of the GM Shannon diversity index ( P<0·05 , Wilcoxon 's signed rank-sum test ) .
Even if it can not be excluded that the age differences between T2D patients ( mean age 66 years ) and healthy controls ( mean age 32 years ) contribute , at least in part , to the observed differences in GM diversity , we failed to detect any significant correlation between age and microbiome diversity in our data set ( online Supplementary Fig. S2 ) .
The PCoA of the weighted UniFrac distances resulted in a significant segregation between the two groups ( Fig. 1(a ) ) ( P<0·001 , permutation test with pseudo F ratios ) , confirming the presence of compositional differences in the GM structure of T2D patients and healthy controls .
To identify the microbial genera responsible for this separation , the biplot of the average bacterial coordinates weighted by the corresponding bacterial abundance per sample was superimposed on the PCoA plot ( Fig. 1(b ) ) , as previously carried out by Lozupone et al. ( 31 ) .
The GM genera that clustered with T2D patients and healthy controls and the corresponding relative abundance values are reported in Table 2 .
According to our biplot analysis , T2D patients showed a higher load of several potentially pro-inflammatory GM components , such as Enterobacteriaceae , Collinsella ( 32 ) and Streptococcus .
In particular , Enterobacteriaceae , Collinsella and Streptococcus were , respectively , 8·5 , 3·5 and 4·1 times more in T2D patients than in healthy controls .
T2D patients also showed a significantly higher abundance of Lactobacillus , with an increase of about 150 times , and Lachnospiraceae : Ruminococcus , which was 1·1 times more than in healthy controls .
Conversely , T2D patients were slightly depleted in several health-promoting SCFA producers , such as Bacteroides ( 0·7 times less ) , Prevotella ( 0·8 times less ) , Lachnospira ( 0·7 times less ) , Roseburia ( 0·2 times less ) and Faecalibacterium ( 0·4 times less ) .
Taken together , our data demonstrate the presence of dysbioses in the GM of T2D patients , characterised by an overall reduction of mutualistic GM components in favour of a corresponding increase in potential pro-inflammatory groups .

Primary and secondary outcomes for the fifty-one patients who completed the trial were provided by Soare et al. ( 21 ) .
As stool samples for gut microbiome characterisation were successfully collected before and after intervention from twenty-one patients assigned to the Ma-Pi 2 diet and nineteen patients assigned to the CTR diet , primary and secondary outcomes were re-analysed in this subset of forty MADIAB participants .
The obtained data confirmed a significant reduction of FBG and PPBG in both diet groups , which was significantly higher for patients following the Ma-Pi 2 diet compared with those following the CTR diet .
With regard to secondary outcomes , the Ma-Pi 2 diet group showed a significantly higher reduction in HOMA-IR , total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol and LDL : HDL ratio compared with the CTR group ( Table 3 ) .
Furthermore , although both diets were effective in reducing the plasma TNF-α levels , only the Ma-Pi 2 dietary intervention resulted in a significant reduction in plasma levels of CRP and IL-6 ( Table 4).Table 3Primary and secondary outcome comparison between Ma-Pi 2 and control ( CTR ) diet at T0 and T1 ( Medians and 1st–3rd quartile ranges)Ma-Pi 2 diet ( n 21)CTR diet ( n 19)T0T1T0T1Median1st–3rd quartileMedian1st–3rd quartile P *

We then explored the impact of dietary interventions on the GM ecosystem of T2D patients .
To visualise the total variation in the data set , a PCoA analysis of the weighted UniFrac distances between the Ma-Pi 2 and CTR groups at T0 and T1 and the healthy controls was performed ( online Supplementary Fig. S3 ) .
The PC2 axis – which accounts for 24 % of the total variability – was positively associated with T2D ( P<0·05 , Wilcoxon 's signed rank-sum test ) .
Thus , the efficacy of dietary interventions in redressing T2D-associated GM-dysbioses was assessed by comparing the variation of the average ( ±sem ) PC2 coordinates for each group of samples ( Fig. 2 ) .
Although at T0 both Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet groups showed significantly higher PC2 coordinates compared with healthy controls ( P=0·01 and P=0·03 , respectively ) , at T1 no significant difference between both diet groups and healthy controls was observed .
These data support the potential of both dietary interventions to redress T2D-associated GM dysbioses , favouring the recovery of a mutualistic ecosystem layout .

The specificity of each dietary intervention in correcting the GM dysbioses in T2D patients was evaluated by comparing the compositional structure of the GM ecosystem before ( T0 ) and after ( T1 ) the nutritional intervention , as reported in the two PCoA plots of weighted UniFrac distances , which also included the responding bacterial genera and biochemical parameters ( Fig. 3 ) .
A significant segregation between the GM profiles at T0 and T1 was obtained for both interventions ( P=0·01 and P=0·04 for Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet , respectively ; permutation test with pseudo F ratios ) , indicating that both diets were effective in modulating the GM of T2D patients .
Although both diets tended to increase the GM Shannon diversity ( P=0·09 and P=0·06 for Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet , respectively ; Wilcoxon 's signed rank-sum test ) , no significant difference in within-group diversity between time points was observed ( Fig. 3 ) .
Interestingly , in the case of the Ma-Pi 2 diet , we detected significant associations between changes in GM components and changes in biochemical parameters ( Fig. 3(a ) ) .
In particular , Faecalibacterium , which increased at T1 , showed an inverse association with FBG .
Analogously , Bacteroides and Akkermansia , both positively responding to the Ma-Pi 2 diet , showed an inverse trend with respect to total and LDL-cholesterol .
Conversely , Lachnospiraceae : Ruminococcus , decreasing after the Ma-Pi 2 diet , was positively associated with FBG.Fig .

To dissect the specific GM compositional changes in response to the dietary regimen , we focused our analysis on the core GM community , defined as the sum of the microbial genera present at a relative abundance > 1 % in at least 30 % of the subjects .
Selected genera accounted together for > 80 % of the total ecosystem .
To estimate the degree of dysbiosis of the core GM in T2D , the ratio of the median genus abundance in T2D patients and healthy controls was calculated .
The heat map of the log-ratios at T0 and T1 for the Ma-Pi 2 and the CTR diet is shown in Fig. 4 .
According to our findings , both diets were effective in counteracting the decrease of Bacteroides , Dorea and Faecalibacterium in T2D patients , as demonstrated by the recovery of median abundance values similar to those of healthy controls .
Moreover , both Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet resulted in an increase of Akkermansia above the abundance values characteristic of healthy controls .
On the other hand , both diets supported the reduction of Lachnospiraceae : Ruminococcus down to the median abundance values shown by healthy controls .
Diet-specific effects on the GM composition of T2D patients regarded only a few genera under-represented in T2D patients compared with healthy controls : Lachnospira and Roseburia , for which only the CTR diet favoured the recovery of health-like median abundance values , and Oscillospira , for which the recovery of health-like values occurred only in the Ma-Pi 2 diet group .
Conversely , the genera Collinsella and Streptococcus , and unclassified Lachnospiraceae , which were enriched in T2D patients compared with healthy controls , decreased down to health-like abundances only in patients who underwent the Ma-Pi 2 diet intervention .

To highlight specific dietary features affecting the GM composition , a comparison between the microbiota profiles at T1 of the two groups was performed , taking into account also the dietary features of the two different interventions ( Fig. 5 ) .
T1 samples from the Ma-Pi 2 diet group showed significantly higher abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae ( P=0·02 ; Wilcoxon 's signed rank-sum test ) and Leuconostocaceae ( P=0·0002 ) , which were also positively correlated with the ingested amount of dietary components that were represented in a higher percentage in Ma-Pi 2 compared with the CTR diet ( whole grain 28·1 v. 8·5 % , vegetables , sauces and herbs 64·5 v. 32·0 % ) , or only present in the Ma-Pi 2 diet ( seeds , seaweeds and fermented products ) ( see also online Supplementary Table S2 ) .
On the contrary , bacteria from the family Erysipelotrichaceae showed significantly higher abundance in T1 samples from the CTR diet group ( P=0·008 ) , and were positively correlated with the ingested amount of dietary components present only in CTR diet ( bread , cereal , pasta and grains , meats , eggs and meat broths , dairy products , fruit and fruit juice and extra-virgin olive oil ) .
The same positive correlations were obtained for Coriobacteriaceae , even if the abundance of this bacterial family was not significantly higher in the CTR diet group T1 samples .
This bacterial group also showed a positive correlation with the food category ' other starch ' ( containing legumes and potatoes ) , which was more represented in the CTR diet than in the Ma-Pi 2 diet ( 5·5 v. 3·0 % ) .
This food category was also correlated to the Ruminococcaceae family .

BODY.RESULTS.IMPACT OF NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION ON THE FUNCTIONAL CONFIGURATION OF THE GUT MICROBIOME OF TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS : To gain insight into the GM functions , gut metagenomes structures were inferred from the respective phylogenetic profiles using PICRUSt ( 28 ) , as previously performed by David et al. ( 19 ) and Morgan et al. ( 33 ) .
A total of 329 KEGG pathways were generated , of these 249 showed a significantly different abundance between healthy controls and T2D patients , and thirty-four showed a significant variation in response to the Ma-Pi 2 diet , whereas no KEGG pathway responded significantly to the CTR diet .
The Procrustes analysis of the 16S rDNA sequences and imputed KO gene data set co-illustrates the data , supporting the significant association between taxonomic and inferred functional profiles of the gut microbiome across our study cohort ( P=0·001 , Protest ; online Supplementary Fig. S4 ) .
The PCoA of the imputed functional GM profiles showing segregation among the Ma-Pi 2 and CTR groups at T0 and T1 and healthy controls is provided as the online Supplementary Fig. S5 .
The Euclidean principal component analysis ( PCA ) of the KO level gene abundances showed separate clustering between the gut microbiome structure of T2D patients at T0 and healthy controls ( P=0·03 , permutation test with pseudo F ratios ) .
To identify functions responsible for this separation , the average coordinates of the metabolic pathways in all samples , weighted by gene count per sample , were obtained and the resulting biplot of pathway distribution was superimposed on the PCA plot ( Fig. 6 ) .
The pathways clustering with T2D patients and healthy controls are listed in the online Supplementary Table S3 .
In the context of this functional separation , T2D patients showed a general perturbation in microbiome pathways involved in the metabolism of amino acids , lipids and secondary metabolites .
In particular , T2D patients were depleted in genes involved in the metabolism of d-arginine and d-ornithine , as well as of d-glutamine and d-glutamate , while being enriched in pathways involved in tyrosine metabolism and alanine , aspartate and glutamate metabolism .
This functional layout may lead to a reduced production of arginine – as a result of both the reduction of pathways directly involved in arginine biosynthesis and the lower amount of glutamate available for arginine biosynthesis – and to a corresponding increase in alanine levels .
Although arginine has been reported as insulinogenic ( 34 ) , an increased alanine production has been connected to augmented energy intake , cholesterol level and BMI ( 35 ) .
Furthermore , an increased tyrosine metabolism in T2D patients could result in higher levels of the 4-cresol metabolite , which has been associated with diverse inflammatory conditions in the gut ( 36 ) .
Finally , compared with healthy controls , the GM of T2D patients showed increased abundance of functions involved in the arachidonic acid metabolism .
Interestingly , the bacterial metabolism of this key inflammatory intermediate is a well-recognised immune-escaping strategy for proteobacteria ( 37 ) .
A higher level of arachidonic acid metabolism in the GM of T2D patients , together with the increase in the biosynthesis of polyketide sugars – bacterial secondary metabolites with a range of biological functions including immunosuppression ( 38 ) – might be the result of the hypothesised bloom of pro-inflammatory pathobionts in the gut .

With the aim to explore the impact of nutritional interventions on the functional configuration of the gut microbiome in T2D patients , the Euclidean PCA of KO level gene abundances at T0 and T1 for both dietary groups was carried out .
Differently from the CTR diet , which resulted in no significant functional change in the predicted gut metagenome ( P=0·4 , permutation test with pseudo F ratios ) , the Ma-Pi 2 diet was effective in modulating the GM metagenome in T2D patients , as demonstrated by significant sample clustering according to the time point ( P=0·007 ) .
As previously described , the corresponding biplot of metabolic pathway distribution was superimposed on the PCA plot ( Fig. 7 ) .
The pathways clustering with the Ma-Pi 2 diet time points are listed in online Supplementary Table S3 .
According to our findings , the Ma-Pi 2 diet effectively counteracted the functional dysbioses in the GM of T2D patients , resulting in the decrease of the abundance of several T2D-associated GM functional markers , such as alanine metabolism , arachidonic acid metabolism and polyketide sugar biosynthesis , as well as in the reduction of GM functions related to oxidative phosphorylation and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis .
Moreover , the Ma-Pi 2 diet favoured an increase in GM functions involved in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism , previously reported as reduced in T2D patients , and in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids , which have been shown to improve lipoprotein profile , glycaemic control and antioxidant status in T2D ( 39 , 40 ) .
Finally , the Ma-Pi 2 diet resulted in the increase of GM pathways involved in the metabolism of taurine , cysteine , methionine , valine , leucine and isoleucine , potentially providing the host with an additional source of important nutrients and essential amino acids .

BODY.DISCUSSION : In the present study , the GM phylogenetic and functional dysbioses in forty overweight T2D patients participating in the MADIAB trial ( 21 ) were explored .
In agreement with previous findings ( 11 ) , T2D involved a significant reduction of the GM diversity , which is a common feature shared by several disease-associated dysbiotic microbiome configurations , such as those associated with inflammatory bowel disease and age ( 41 , 42 ) .
According to our results , the reduction of the GM compositional diversity in T2D corresponded to phylogenetic changes .
T2D patients were indeed enriched in Lactobacillus , Lachnospiraceae : Ruminococcus and in several potential pro-inflammatory GM components , such as Enterobacteriaceae , Collinsella and Streptococcus ( 32 , 39 , 43 – 46 ) , whereas they were depleted in important health-promoting SCFA producers , such as members of Lachnospiraceae , Faecalibacterium , Bacteroides and Prevotella .
Strengthening these findings , analogous T2D-associated GM structural dysbioses have already been identified in previous studies ( 3 , 6 , 7 , 47 ) .
Subsequently , we explored the changes in GM functions matching these compositional perturbations by inferred metagenomics .
Our data suggest deregulation in pathways involved in the metabolism of amino acids , lipids and secondary metabolites in the GM of T2D patients , including a reduced abundance of functions for the metabolism of d-arginine and d-ornithine , as well as of d-glutamine and d-glutamate , a corresponding increase in the metabolism of tyrosine , alanine , aspartate and glutamate , and a higher load of functions involved in arachidonic acid metabolism and polyketide sugar biosynthesis .
The observed T2D-related dysbiotic microbial community could exert a multifactorial role in the disease onset , contributing to metabolic and immune deregulation .
Indeed , the T2D GM is slightly depleted in fibrolytic health-promoting mutualists , fundamental for providing butyrate and propionate from the degradation of indigestible plant polysaccharides and starch , such as the butyrate-producing Dorea , Lachnospira , Roseburia and Faecalibacterium , and the propionate-producing Bacteroides and Prevotella ( 48 ) .
Even if the biological relevance of this depletion of SCFA producers remains to be determined , it could result in the reduction of bioavailability of these crucial GM metabolites in the gut , with consequences on the host metabolic and immunological homeostasis .
For instance , butyrate and propionate are important for host glucose control ( 11 ) , insulin sensitivity regulation , insulin signalling and intestinal gluconeogenesis ( 9 , 49 ) ; also , they represent potent immune modulators , being involved in peripheral regulatory T-cell generation ( 50 ) and in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production ( 51 ) .
In parallel , the observed increase of potential pro-inflammatory micro-organisms in the gut of T2D patients , such as Enterobacteriaceae , Collinsella and Streptococcus ( 32 , 39 , 43 – 46 ) , could further contribute to raise the host inflammatory level , supporting the evolution of insulin resistance ( 52 ) .
Finally , the functional GM layout of T2D patients we obtained by imputed metagenomics suggests additional mechanisms involved in the GM contribution to the disease , including the reduced production of the insulinogenic arginine ( 34 ) , and the increased production of alanine , a recognised marker of higher energy intake and cholesterol level ( 35 ) , which could contribute to the loss of metabolic control in T2D .
Moreover , the higher potential for the production of tyrosine metabolites could further boost pro-inflammatory stimuli in the gut ( 36 ) .
Interestingly , the survey of GM in T2D patients allowed us to find traces of functions related to immune escaping , such as pathways involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid and polyketide sugar biosynthesis , further highlighting the ongoing bloom of pro-inflammatory GM components in T2D ( 39 ) .
However , the functional conclusions derived from imputed metagenomics must be taken with caution until experimentally confirmed by shotgun metagenomics .
In the subset of forty MADIAB participants – twenty-one assigned to the Ma-Pi 2 diet and nineteen to the CTR diet – we then explored the efficacy of the nutritional interventions in supporting the recovery of a mutualistic GM configuration in T2D patients .
Primary and secondary outcomes were re-analysed for this patient subset included in the gut microbiome study , confirming that the Ma-Pi 2 diet was associated with a greater reduction in FBG and PPBG , total serum cholesterol , CRP and IL-6 in T2D patients .
According to gut microbiome data , both Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet were able to modulate the GM dysbioses in T2D patients , supporting the recovery of a healthy-like compositional structure and resulting in an increased ecosystem diversity , which represents a strategic feature for a healthy GM ecosystem ( 53 ) .
In addition , both diets supported the recovery of a balanced health-promoting community of fibrolytic SCFA producers in the gut of T2D patients , by re-increasing the abundance of propionate and butyrate producers ( i.e. Bacteroides , Dorea , Faecalibacterium ) and consolidating a healthy-like abundance of Roseburia , Lachnospira , Lachnospiraceae : Ruminococcus and Oscillospira .
Moreover , both dietary interventions resulted in the increase of Akkermansia , a human mucus coloniser recently correlated to an improved metabolic profile ( 54 ) , providing the rationale for its use in the prevention or treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders .
Finally , it is important to point out that only the Ma-Pi 2 diet showed the potential to counteract the rise of putative pro-inflammatory components ( i.e. Collinsella and Streptococcus ) in the GM ecosystem of T2D patients .
When we sought associations between GM components and biochemical parameters , significant trends were obtained only in the case of the Ma-Pi 2 diet .
Indeed , in Ma-Pi 2-treated subjects , the abundance of Faecalibacterium was negatively associated with FBG and , analogously , the abundance of Bacteroides and Akkermansia showed an inverse association with total and LDL-cholesterol .
Conversely , Lachnospiraceae : Ruminococcus was positively associated with FBG .
These findings suggest that these micro-organisms , the first increasing and the latter decreasing in response to the Ma-Pi 2 diet , could represent Ma-Pi 2-responding GM components associated with primary and secondary study outcomes .
Supporting our findings , the negative association between Faecalibacterium and FBG concentration had already been detected in a study exploring the structural modulation of the GM in T2D subjects treated with a Chinese herbal formula ( 55 ) .
Moreover , in a study carried out in mice , Akkermansia muciniphila treatment has been demonstrated to reverse high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders , including fat-mass gain , metabolic endotoxaemia , adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance ( 54 ) .
On the other hand , Lachnospiraceae : Ruminococcus has recently been positively correlated with insulin resistance in obese women ( 56 ) .
According to imputed metagenomics , only the Ma-Pi 2 diet resulted in a significant modulation of the functional microbiome layout in T2D patients .
In particular , the decrease of several markers of functional GM dysbioses in T2D patients , such as imbalances in alanine metabolism , arachidonic acid metabolism and polyketide sugar biosynthesis , was observed .
Moreover , the Ma-Pi 2 diet favoured the reduction of GM functions related to oxidative phosphorylation and glycosphingolipids biosynthesis .
Anaerobic respiration provides an ecological advantage for Enterobacteriaceae in an inflamed gut ( 39 ) , whereas glycosphingolipids are powerful bacterial modulators of the host inflammatory response ( 40 ) .
Thus , the reduction in abundance of these pathways further suggests the potential of Ma-Pi 2 diet to counteract the ongoing bloom of pro-inflammatory pathobionts in T2D .
Finally , the Ma-Pi 2 diet favoured the increase of GM functions involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and essential amino acids , showing an added potential to promote the recovery of metabolic control and a balanced nutritional status in T2D patients .
In conclusion , both Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diets showed the potential to support the recovery of GM-host mutualism in T2D patients , favouring the restoration of fibrolytic SCFA-producing GM components , thus promoting metabolic control of T2D patients .
Differently from the CTR diet , the Ma-Pi 2 diet was effective in counteracting the rise of possible pro-inflammatory micro-organisms in T2D patients .
This suggests that the Ma-Pi 2 diet may have the potential to reduce GM-dependent pro-inflammatory stimuli in the gut that , increasing chronic inflammation , can lead to insulin resistance in T2D ( 57 ) .
Even if direct causation still needs to be proved , and this conclusion must be taken with adequate caution , this peculiar property shown by the Ma-Pi 2 diet could partly explain the greater improvements in metabolic control following Ma-Pi 2 dietary intervention compared with the CTR diet ( 21 ) .
