TITLE : Feasibility and Effectiveness of an Automated Bilingual Text Message Intervention for Weight Loss : Pilot Study ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Little is known about the feasibility and acceptability of tailored text message based weight loss programs for English and Spanish-language speakers .
ABSTRACT.OBJECTIVE : This pilot study evaluated the feasibility , acceptability , and estimated impact of a tailored text message based weight loss program for English and Spanish-language speakers .
The purpose of this pilot study was to inform the development of a full-scale randomized trial .
ABSTRACT.METHODS : There were 20 overweight or obese participants ( mean age 40.10 , SD 8.05 ; 8/20 , 40 % male ; 9/20 , 45 % Spanish-speakers ) that were recruited in San Diego , California , from March to May 2011 and evaluated in a one-group pre/post clinical trial .
For 8 weeks , participants received and responded to 3 - 5 text messages daily sent from a fully automated text messaging system .
They also received printed weight loss materials and brief 10 - 15 minute weekly counseling calls .
To estimate the impact of the program , the primary outcome was weight ( kg ) measured during face-to-face measurement visits by trained research staff .
Pre and post differences in weight were analyzed with a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance .
Differences by language preference at both time points were analyzed with t tests .
Body mass index and weight management behaviors also were examined .
Feasibility and acceptability were determined by recruitment success , adherence ( ie , percentage of replies to interactive text messages and attrition ) , and participant satisfaction .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Participants who completed the final assessment ( N=18 ) decreased body weight by 1.85 kg ( F 1,17=10.80 , P=.004 , CI∆ 0.66 - 3.03 , η2=0.39 ) .
At both time points , there were no differences in weight by language preference .
Participants responded to 88.04 % ( 986/1120 ) of interactive text messages , attrition rate was 10 % ( 2/20 ) , and 94 % ( 19/20 ) of participants reported satisfaction with the program .
ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This fully automated text message based weight program was feasible with English and Spanish-speakers and may have promoted modest weight loss over an 8-week period .

BODY.INTRODUCTION : Text message based programs to promote behavior change are a rapidly growing area of research .
This inexpensive , instantaneous , two-way communication of brief written messages via a mobile phone has many capabilities that may be useful for promoting weight loss .
For example , texting features can support important constructs in behavior change theories such as cues to action , reinforcement , goal setting , goal reminders , and feedback .
Text messages can be used as a stand-alone program [ 1 - 4 ] or can be integrated easily with other wireless or networked technologies [ 5,6 ] .
Studies have demonstrated that text messages promote improved diet [ 5 ] , increased physical activity ( PA ) [ 4,7 - 10 ] , behavioral strategies like self-monitoring [ 3 ] , and weight loss [ 1,2,6,11,12 ] .
However , more research is needed regarding long-term efficacy and best practices of these programs , in particular in diverse populations .
This pilot study evaluated feasibility and acceptability of a tailored text message based weight loss program for English and Spanish-language speakers and enabled an estimate as to its impact on weight status .
The purpose of this pilot study was to inform the development of a full-scale randomized trial .
BODY.METHODS.UNBLINDED ONE-GROUP PRE/POST DESIGN : We used an unblinded one-group pre/post design .
The Institutional Review Board of University of California , San Diego ( UCSD ) approved this study .
This manuscript is in accordance with the CONSORT-EHEALTH checklist [ 13 ] and is a registered trial ( NCT01171586 ) .
BODY.METHODS.RECRUITMENT : Participants were recruited in San Diego , California , from March to May 2011 via newspapers , flyers , online announcements , and participant recommendations .
The first 20 individuals who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled , with a goal of 40 % ( 8/20 ) male and 50 % ( 10/20 ) self-identified Spanish-speaking .
Bilingual speakers choose language-message preference .
Eligible individuals were 21 - 60 years of age , had a body mass index ( BMI ) of 27.0 - 39.9 , had a cellphone capable of sending and receiving text messages , were current users of texting or willing/able to learn , and could communicate in English or Spanish .
Participants were excluded if they could not engage in moderate intensity PA , were pregnant or intended to become pregnant during the study , had a history of substance abuse or psychiatric disorders that would impair compliance , were using weight-altering medications , or were enrolled in another weight loss program .
At baseline , potential participants were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and underwent written informed consent .
Participants were compensated $ 75 for participation and $ 10 for a text message plan .
BODY.METHODS.INTERVENTION : Social cognitive theory [ 14 ] , control theory [ 15 ] , and ecological theory [ 16 ] informed the intervention .
It integrated these theoretical approaches with evidence-based behavioral strategies for improving diet and PA .
Strategies include self-monitoring , intention formation , goal setting , goal review , feedback on performance , self-efficacy , benefits , barriers , problem-solving , social support , and tailoring .
The 8-week intervention included : ( 1 ) 3 - 5 automatically scheduled and tailored text messages per day .
Message content focused on diet and PA weight management behaviors and strategies ; ( 2 ) a printed weight loss binder organized by weekly weight management topics such as portion control , increasing PA , reducing sedentary behavior , and self-monitoring ; and ( 3 ) brief weekly 10 - 15 minute counseling calls to provide encouragement and reinforcement .
A database was developed of more than 3000 text messages .
The research group translated and culturally tailored the messages to Spanish-speakers to ensure linguistic and cultural equivalence .
Approximately one-quarter of messages requested a reply , with the balance providing tips , suggestions , and positive reinforcement or encouragement for improved behaviors .
The following shows sample messages sent and received from ConTxt ( San Diego , CA 2011 ) : ( 1 ) ConTxt – What is your weight today ? , ( 2 ) Participant–220 , ( 3 ) ConTxt – Congratulations !
You have lost 5 lbs since starting ConTxt , ( 4 ) ConTxt – Here 's a healthy tip , put your pedometer on your nightstand so you can remember to put it on in the morning , ( 5 ) ConTxt – Work on your goal of reducing portion sizes this week by buying single serving pre-packaged snacks , and ( 6 ) ConTxt – Thank you .
Your response has been recorded .
A total of 1500 rules were added to control what message was sent based on the weekly behavioral strategy , day of the week , and time of day , as well as other parameters such as self-reported weight management behaviors and pedometer step count .
A baseline dietary assessment of weight management behaviors was conducted using the Weight Behavior Inventory ( WBI ) to identify unique diet and PA behavior challenges for each participant contributing to high-energy intake and low-energy expenditure .
A computerized expert system processed these data to create individualized goals based on predetermined logic rules .
Goals were presented to the user via text message to serve as prompts for behavioral improvements .
The system is designed so participants who show rapid and sustained progress can advance through content , while those experiencing difficulties can receive additional tips and suggestions .
BODY.METHODS.MEASURES : Outcomes were measured at baseline and 8 weeks by trained research staff at UCSD research offices during face-to-face visits .
The primary outcome was weight ( kg ) measured using a calibrated scale .
Secondary measures included BMI calculated as kg/m2 and weight management behaviors associated with weight loss measured with the 35-item WBI ( validation study under review , Kolodziejczyk et al 2013 ) .
The WBI was adapted from the validated Eating Behavior Inventory [ 17,18 ] .
Each behavior on the WBI is rated on a five-point scale .
Total scores are averaged and can range from 1 - 5 .
Sample items include " I keep one or two raw vegetables available for snacks " and " I decide ahead of time what I will eat for meals and snacks .
" Feasibility and acceptability were measured by recruitment success , adherence , and participant satisfaction .
Recruitment was deemed successful if we achieved our enrollment goal of 20 participants in two months .
Adherence was measured by percentage of replies to interactive text messages ( ie , text messages requesting a reply ) and attrition rate .
Satisfaction was measured using a Likert scale that asked about level of satisfaction with the program , as well as program components .
In addition , we asked open-ended questions about elements of the program such as what they liked the least and best .
BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Pre and post differences between weight , BMI , and WBI scores were analyzed with one-way repeated measures analysis of variance .
WBI score differences between gender and language preference at each time point were analyzed with independent sample t tests .
Analyses used an alpha level < .05 and were conducted using SPSS Statistics 17.0 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Illinois ) .
BODY.RESULTS.PARTICIPANTS : A total of 18 out of the 20 participants completed all measures ( ie , two participants completed the program but did not show for their final assessment ) .
On average , the sample was obese and had approximately equal percentages of participants across demographic categories .

At baseline , there were no differences in WBI scores by gender ( t 18=0.71 , P=.48 , CIΔ −0.31 to 0.62 ) .
There were no baseline differences by language preference and weight ( t 18=0.14 , P=.89 , CIΔ −15.44 to 17.60 ) , BMI ( t 18= −0.51 , P=.61 , CIΔ −4.80 to 2.91 ) , or WBI scores ( t 18=1.01 , P=.33 , CIΔ −0.23 to 0.67 ) .
At 8 weeks , there were no differences in WBI scores by gender ( t 16=0.81 , P=.43 , CIΔ −0.54 to 0.24 ) , but participants preferring Spanish language had higher WBI scores ( mean 2.87 , SD 0.33 ) than English-preference participants ( mean 2.48 , SD 0.32 ; t 16=−2.60 , P=.02 , CIΔ −0.72 to −0.07 ) .
There were no differences at 8 weeks by language preference and weight ( t 16=0.07 , P=.95 , CIΔ −19.16 to 20.47 ) or BMI ( t 16=−0.36 , P=.73 , CIΔ −5.34 to 3.80 ) .

Participants responded to 88.04 % ( 986/1120 ) of interactive text messages , and there was a low 10 % ( 2/20 ) attrition rate .
Most participants ( 94 % , 19/20 ) reported satisfaction with the program .
Participants also reported the program helped motivate and reinforce healthier habits and choices ( n=5 ) , encouraged portion control and awareness of energy intake ( n=4 ) , and taught how to be more active ( n=5 ) .
Some challenges participants reported included feelings of withdrawal after the program ended ( n=7 ) and technical issues with their phone , which sometimes hindered message response ( n=4 ) .
BODY.DISCUSSION.THE WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM : An 8-week text message based weight loss program was found to be both feasible and acceptable in terms of recruitment interest , participant adherence , and satisfaction .
The program may have had positive effects on weight management behaviors and weight outcomes , although this needs to be confirmed in a study with a stronger design .
These results are consistent with previous text message based weight loss studies [ 1,2,11 ] .
Based on information we received from this pilot , some changes to be implemented in the full-scale trial include user-initiated messages ( eg , suggestions for restaurant meals , PA ) , more message personalization ( eg , names of social supporters , PA locations ) , a greater focus on participant message preference ( eg , participants will be able to set text message preferences through the use of a like/unlike system ) , inclusion of " milestone " and " competitive " messages based on weight and pedometer step count ( eg , when a participant reaches a certain milestone , such as five pounds lost , he or she will receive a congratulatory message , and the system will compare the participant 's weight loss with the groups ' weight loss ) , and improvements to system programming to reduce technical errors ( eg , a participant not receiving the correct follow-up message ) .
In addition , based on feedback from the Spanish-language speaking participants , we made some of the Spanish materials clearer ( eg , more pictures , simpler language ) .
BODY.DISCUSSION.STUDY LIMITATIONS : Study limitations include a small sample , a short time frame , and a one-group pre/post design .
Therefore , our findings are suggestive rather than conclusive .
Based upon these pilot study findings a full-scale randomized controlled trial currently is underway enrolling 298 participants for a one-year intervention .
