TITLE : Peer support and improved quality of life among persons living with HIV on antiretroviral treatment : A randomised controlled trial from north-eastern Vietnam ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Among people living with HIV ( PLHIV ) on antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , it is important to determine how quality of life ( QOL ) may be improved and HIV-related stigma can be lessened over time .
This study assessed the effect of peer support on QOL and internal stigma during the first year after initiating ART among a cohort of PLHIV in north-eastern Vietnam .
ABSTRACT.METHODS : A sub-sample study of a randomised controlled trial was implemented between October 2008 and November 2010 in Quang Ninh , Vietnam .
In the intervention group , participants ( n = 119 ) received adherence support from trained peer supporters who visited participants ' houses biweekly during the first two months , thereafter weekly .
In the control group , participants ( n = 109 ) were treated according to standard guidelines , including adherence counselling , monthly health check and drug refills .
Basic demographics were measured at baseline .
QOL and internal stigma were measured using a Vietnamese version of the WHOQOL-HIVBREF and Internal AIDS-related Stigma Scale instruments at baseline and 12 months .
T-tests were used to detect the differences between mean values , multilevel linear regressions to determine factors influencing QOL .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Overall , QOL improved significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group .
Among participants initiating ART at clinical stages 3 and 4 , education at high school level or above and having experiences of a family member dying from HIV were also associated with higher reported QOL .
Among participants at clinical stage 1 and 2 , there was no significant effect of peer support , whereas having children was associated with an increased QOL .
Viral hepatitis was associated with a decreased QOL in both groups .
Lower perceived stigma correlated significantly but weakly with improved QOL , however , there was no significant relation to peer support .
ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The peer support intervention improved QOL after 12 months among ART patients presenting at clinical stages 3 and 4 at baseline , but it had no impact on QOL among ART patients enrolled at clinical stages 1 and 2 .
The intervention did not have an effect on Internal AIDS-related stigma .
To improve QOL for PLHIV on ART , measures to support adherence should be contextualized in accordance with individual clinical and social needs .
BODY.BACKGROUND : The HIV epidemic in Vietnam is in a concentrated stage , with an estimated HIV prevalence of 0.53 % in 2010 [ 1 ] .
Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) has been scaled-up in Vietnam since late 2005 with funding through programs such as the US President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) and Global Fund to fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria ( GFATM ) .
By December 2010 , about 49,492 persons living with HIV ( PLHIV ) in Vietnam had access to free ART [ 2 ] .
The world-wide scale-up of ART has decreased the incidence of new HIV infection and reduced AIDS-related deaths substantially [ 3 ] .
With an increased prevalence of PLHIV on life-long ART , it is becoming increasingly important to determine which factors contribute to a better quality of life ( QOL ) .
While people are living longer , they may be living with increased health-challenges related to HIV disease , the side effects of treatment or emerging concurrent morbidities related to HIV or aging .
Hence , despite living longer , individuals may not always be ' living well ' .
Quality of life has become an essential outcome to consider in the overall health and well-being of people living with HIV .
Whereas it is well documented that ART improves not only clinical outcomes but also QOL within the first year [ 4,5 ] , conclusions on what other factors ( besides the ART itself ) can contribute to a higher QOL are diverse [ 6,7 ] .
Several factors have been identified as contributing to better QOL among PLHIV , including social support [ 8,9 ] , spiritual well-being [ 9 ] , education level [ 10,11 ] , not being an injecting drug user [ 12,13 ] and having good adherence to ART [ 14,15 ] .
Meanwhile , other factors such as HIV-related stigma [ 16 - 18 ] , non-disclosure of one 's HIV status have been reported to negatively affect QOL [ 19 ] .
Due to the strong relationship between QOL and many important indicators for treatment success , QOL has been widely applied in evaluating the impact of HIV-related interventions among different populations [ 20,21 ] .
In settings with heavy HIV-related stigma and discrimination and limited health care resources , such as Vietnam [ 22 ] , scaling up HIV care faces challenges , including shortages of health care personnel willing to work with HIV-infected individuals resulting in heavy workloads and constrained support to patient adherence .
To counter this , community-based peer support interventions have sought to improve adherence to ART , to lessen internal HIV-related stigma as well as to improve treatment outcomes such as QOL [ 23 ] .
However , to date , there is no available data evaluating such an intervention in Vietnam .
In this randomized controlled trial , we assess the impact of peer support on QOL and internal stigma for PLHIV after 12 months on ART .
BODY.METHODS.GENERAL STUDY DESIGN : This study focusing on QOL is a sub-sample of a cluster randomized controlled trial aiming to assess the impact of peer support on viral suppression and resistance development among patients in Quang Ninh province in north-eastern Vietnam ( DOTARV ) .
BODY.METHODS.STUDY SETTING : The study was conducted at four outpatient clinics ( OPC ) in Quang Ninh , a province in the northeast of Vietnam with a population of 1.1 million .
Quang Ninh 's economy is rapidly growing and mainly based on industries such as coalmines , cement plants and harbours as well as tourism within the famous Ha Long Bay .
It is also the area that is hardest hit by the HIV epidemic in Vietnam , with an estimated HIV prevalence of slightly above 1 % among 15 - 49-year-olds [ 24 ] .
BODY.METHODS.SAMPLING AND PARTICIPANTS : The study sample was selected from four districts in Quang Ninh province , which consisted of 71 communes ( 28 urban and 43 rural ) .
The total population of the 71 communes was 612,541 in 2009 .
Cluster-based sampling at the level of the commune was employed in order to minimize contamination between patients living near each other .
In cluster sampling , the 71 communes were randomised to either intervention ( 36 communes ) or control ( 35 communes ) , after an initial matching according to rural – urban , population and vicinity to hospital .
In both intervention and control communes , all patients who came from the same commune were then treated similarly in a standardized way according to the study protocol .
The study enrolled HIV positive patients who were ARV-naïve and eligible to initiate ART according to the Vietnamese national guidelines at the time of the study .
Inclusion criteria were as following : clinical stage 4 of HIV disease ( AIDS related illnesses ) regardless of CD4 + count , clinical stage 3 ( severe opportunistic infections ) with CD4 + < 350/μl , clinical stage 1 and 2 ( asymptomatic or mild infection ) with CD4 + count of < 200/μl [ 25 ] .
Exclusion criteria were pregnancy , age under 18 or above 60 , mental illness and institutionalization .
While the larger DOTARV study began in 2007 , the present sub-study focusing on QOL and internal stigma included all DOTARV participants recruited from October 2008 to November 2009 .
Two-hundred seventy-five participants were consecutively selected from both the intervention and the control groups ( i.e. all persons eligible for ART and meeting inclusion criteria from both intervention and control communes were enrolled in this sub-study ) .
Among these , 24 died within six months of ART initiation , twelve patients did not come for the interview at twelve months and eleven dropped out of the study as per compulsory detoxification or arrested due to heroin trafficking .
A total of 228 participants responded to the interview both at baseline and at twelve months .
BODY.METHODS.CONTROL : Those individuals who were randomized to the control arm of the study received standard care as per normal government health care standards for patients initiating ART .
This included adherence counselling and readiness training provided by the medical staff of these OPCs at individual level ( three times ) and at group level ( three times ) prior to starting ART .
Health checks , adherence assessment and drug refills were carried out monthly at the outpatient clinic .
All patients would report their obstacles/barriers to ART adherence ( if any ) to health staff at the OPCs at monthly visits .
In case non-adherence to ART was identified by health staff , adherence counselling would be provided instantly on location .
The adherence assessment in this study was based on the self-reports from the patients as well as pills counts .
These were both compared to the amount of the pills that should have been taken using the criteria recommended by WHO [ 26 ] .
The adherence assessment then referred to : good adherence ( patient forgot to take doses less than four times per month ) ; moderate adherence ( patient forgot to take doses between 4–8 times per month ) and poor adherence ( patient forgot to take doses more than 8 times per month ) .
BODY.METHODS.INTERVENTION : Individuals in the intervention arm of the study received standard care as described above and also received peer support from trained PLHIV who were taking ART .
These peers functioned as " external supporters " for patients initiating ART and performed biweekly visits during the initial two months of ART , when drug-taking habits were being formed .
After two months , the visits were reduced to once per week ( if treatment adherence was good ) or intensified to become more frequent ( if adherence was poor ) .
To facilitate the peer support activities and ensure that the adherence support was carried out properly , a standardized checklist was developed by the research group together with a group of PLHIV who were on ART .
The checklist was used to guide the peer supporter to ask questions in a standardized order and manner .
During each visit , the external supporter went through this standardized checklist including questions about general well-being , signs/symptoms since the last visit , psychological problems or adverse drugs reactions as well as adherence to therapy since the last visit .
The checklist was only applied in the intervention group and hence it was not used for data collection or for monitoring the effects of the intervention .
Patients and family members were encouraged to report all constraints/obstacles to ART adherence .
Barriers to ART adherence identified during the visiting were discussed between the peer supporter , the patient and family members to determine a feasible solution and ( if necessary ) health staff at the outpatient clinic were contacted for advice .
Problems identified by peer supporters such as common barriers , suggestions for changing dose-taking schedules , behaviour of family member towards peer supporter ( if any ) were discussed among the research group at monthly meetings .
BODY.METHODS.MEASUREMENT TOOLS : Study tools administered to both intervention and control participants included : The WHOQOL-HIVBREF includes questions respond to the definition of Quality of Life as Individuals ' perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value system in which they live and in relation to their goals , expectation , standards and concerns .
This measurement produced scores on the patients ' self-reported judgement of six different domains of QOL including : Physical ( 4 facets : pain , energy , sleep , symptoms ) ; Psychological ( 5 facets : positive feelings , cognitive , self- esteem , bodily image , negative feelings ) ; Social Relationships ( 4 facets : personal relationships , social support , sexual activity , social inclusion ) ; Level of Independence ( 4 facets : mobility , daily activities , dependence on medication , work capacity ) ; Environment ( 8 facets : physical safety and security , home environment , financial resources , health and social care , opportunities for acquiring new information , opportunity for leisure activities , physical environment , transport ) and Spirituality/Personal Beliefs ( 4 facets : forgiveness and blame , concern about the future , death , spirituality ) .
The patients answered each question using a 5-level Likert scale .
Among these , scores of questions with negative direction ( negative feelings , pain and discomfort , dependence on medicine , death ) were reversed to make higher scores generally indicate better QOL .
The score of each domain ranged between 4 and 20 .
These scores could also be added up to produce an overall score .
The higher scores indicated better QOL [ 27 ] .
The difference between the score at 12 months and the score at baseline was then used to express the change in QOL ( both for each separate domain and for the overall score ) .
We strictly followed the protocol provided by the WHOQOL-HIV Group to translate and using forward-backward translation with subsequent reviews and discussions within the research groups .
The Internal AIDS-Related stigma questionnaire focused on self-blame and concealment of HIV status [ 28 ] .
This measurement assessed if patients agreed with statements including : It is difficult to tell people about my HIV infection ; Being HIV positive makes me feeling dirty ; I feel guilty that I am HIV positive ; I am ashamed that I am HIV positive ; I sometimes feel worthless because I am HIV positive ; and I hide my HIV status from others .
Participants responded to each question by agree = 1 or disagree = 0 .
The total scores ranged from 0 to 6 .
Lower scores at 12 months means lessened stigma over time .
Both WHOQOL-HIVBREF and Internal AIDS-related stigma measurement tools were pre-tested , revised and validated prior to beginning data collection .
Baseline characteristics of the participants were collected through a baseline questionnaire that included socioeconomic characteristics ( age , sex , education level , occupation , marital status , number of children , housing , income ) and HIV-related characteristics ( HIV transmission routes , the duration of knowing their HIV status , other family member infected with HIV or died from HIV , alcohol and drug use behaviours , hepatitis co-infection , clinical staging ) .
Data on QOL and internal AIDS-related stigma were collected in a separate room at the outpatient clinic through self-administered questionnaires after participants were provided with instructions on how to fill them in by a member of the health staff .
These assessments were carried out at initiation of treatment and then every four months in connection to the participants ' scheduled monthly drug pick-up with a planned follow-up time of one year .
BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Data collected were processed and analysed using SPSS version 13 and STATA version 10 .
Proportions , means and standard deviations ( SDs ) were used for the descriptive analysis .
Chi-square tests were performed to examine the difference between proportions ( sex , age distribution , marital status , occupations , education level , current and past IDU , clinical stage , member of family infected with HIV or died from HIV ) .
WHOQOL-HIVBREF scores and stigma scale scores were assessed for normal distributions .
T-tests were used to detect the difference between mean values of QOL scores or Stigma scores in both related samples model and independent samples model .
Pearson 's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation between quantitative variables [ 29 ] .
Stepwise multiple linear regression and multilevel linear regression methods were used to estimate the causal relationship between QOL change between baseline and 12 months and independent variables .
We used default cut-offs provided by SPSS in stepwise multiple linear regression ( 0.05 to enter in the model and 0.10 to be removed from the model ) to choose the most influential independent variables .
Then multilevel linear regression was applied to justify the effects of intra cluster correlation .
Intra cluster correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) were calculated to evaluate the similarity of QOL within clusters ( communes ) .
In all the tests and regression models , p-values less than 5 % were considered significant .
Longitudinal approach was attempted in order to take the values of the QOL at different time points ( baseline , 4 months , 8 months , 12 months ) into account .
However , due to the small sample size , the change in QOL during the 4 months intervals was not significant .
Thus , only the results related to QOL at baseline and 12 months are presented here .
BODY.RESULTS : Among 228 ARV-naïve patients recruited to the QOL study within the DOTARV project from October 2008 to November 2009 , there were 119 in the intervention group and 109 in the control group .
Characteristics of the study participants at baseline are described in Table 1 .
There were no significant differences in these characteristics between the two groups .

BODY.RESULTS.QOL IN THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS : Overall , QOL of the whole cohort seemed to increase over time , with a mean score of 76.5 at baseline and 77.3 after one year of ART , but this difference was not significant ( p = 0.295 ) .
However , stratification by intervention – control groups and clinical stages showed different patterns .
Table 2 shows the results of the QOL scores that changed over time within each group .
In the intervention group , overall QOL scores and QOL scores of physical and independent capacity increased mainly among patients who presented at clinical stages 3 and 4 .
Among patients who presented at clinical stages 1 and 2 , QOL scores increased slightly in independent capacity ( p = 0.033 ) but decreased in the domain of environment ( p = 0.001 ) .
In the control group , QOL increased only in independent capacity among patients presented at clinical stages 3 and 4 .

Among participants enrolled with more severe immunosuppression at baseline ( clinical stage 3 and 4 ) , there was a significant association between peer support and improved overall QOL ( p = 0.034 ) , more specifically the QOL domains of physical well-being ( p = 0.007 ) , level of independence ( p = 0.038 ) and spirituality ( p = 0.029 ) .
Meanwhile , among participants those were less symptomatic when beginning ART ( clinical stage 1 or 2 ) , there were no significant differences between the two groups in overall QOL or in any of the specific domains ( Table 3 ) .

BODY.RESULTS.FACTORS INFLUENCING QOL IMPROVEMENT.RESULTS AMONG PATIENTS PRESENTED AT CLINICAL STAGES 3 AND 4 : Participants had significant improvement in overall QOL after 12 months if they had higher education ( p = 0.01 ) , previously had an experience of a family member dying from HIV ( p < 0.001 ) or received peer support ( " borderline " p = 0.080 ) .
The influences of intervention and other factors to specific domains are also described in Table 5 .
People with higher education had significant improvement in Psychological wellbeing ( p = 0.044 ) and Spirituality/personal beliefs ( p = 0.001 ) .
Meanwhile , experience of a family member dying from HIV gave positive contributions for almost all domains of QOL Conversely , Hepatitis C and/or B co-infection was significantly associated with decreased Physical wellbeing ( p = 0.021 ) .
BODY.RESULTS.FACTORS INFLUENCING QOL IMPROVEMENT.RESULTS AMONG PATIENTS PRESENTING AT CLINICAL STAGES 1 AND 2 : Peer support did not appear to have any impact ( Table 5 ) .
In this group , for those with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection , overall QOL decreased significantly ( p = 0.017 ) after 12 months of follow-up , specifically for the QOL domains of psychological well-being ( p = 0.043 ) , level of independence ( p = 0.014 ) , social relations ( p = 0.011 ) and environment aspect ( p < 0.001 ) .
Whilst , having children in family can help to have better Spirituality/personal beliefs ( p = 0.004 ) and then to improve QOL ( p = 0.036 ) .
BODY.RESULTS.QOL AND INTERNAL AIDS-RELATED STIGMA : The average internal AIDS-related stigma scores for both intervention and control groups ) at baseline and after 12 months were 3.21 ( SD = 1.96 ) and 3.27 ( SD = 1.80 ) respectively .
The internal AIDS-related stigma did not differ between the intervention and control groups or between the different clinical stage groups after 12 months .
There was a significant association between value of QOL change over time and changes in internal AIDS-related stigma ( p < 0.001 ) .
However , this is not a strong correlation with a correlation coefficient of −0.36 .
Patients who reported improved QOL after 12 months on ART also reported decreased stigma and vice versa .
BODY.DISCUSSION : This is the first study , to our knowledge , that shows a positive effect of peer support on QOL among severely immunosuppressed patients initiating ART in the context of a randomised controlled trial .
We found that peer support had a very different effect on QOL depending on the patient 's clinical condition when starting ART .
Those with severe immunosuppression and opportunistic infections ( clinical stages 3 or 4 ) who received extra adherence support from a trained peer supporter reported significantly improved QOL after 12 months on ART compared to a control group who received standard care .
This improvement in the intervention group was not found among patients who were asymptomatic or who had mild symptoms ( clinical stage 1 or 2 ) when ART was initiated .
QOL was particularly improved among severely immunosuppressed intervention-group patients in the domains that relate to the clinical condition such as physical well-being , level of independence and spirituality ( perceptions about the future or worrying about death ) .
For other QOL domains ( psychology , social relationships and environment ) improvement appeared to depend on individual factors such as level of education and earlier experience of a family member dying from HIV rather than on contact with a peer supporter .
The improvement in QOL in some segments of the intervention group might have been because the peer supporters were able to utilise their own experiences as PLHIV to empathically listen , understand , advise and assist the patients to problem-solve .
In addition , as the peer supporters had received training , they could act as intermediaries between patients and health care providers [ 30 ] , giving information , counselling and assisting patients to contact health staff when needed [ 23 ] , particularly in cases the patients experienced severe symptoms that could influence QOL negatively [ 31 ] .
While QOL became better over time among patients started ART in advanced stage of HIV/AIDS ( clinical stage 3 or 4 ) , the patients who had not experienced AIDS and opportunistic infections ( clinical stage 1 or 2 ) often showed a decline QOL after baseline [ 32 ] .
They might have perceived the regular visits of the external supporters as annoying or threatening due to the risk of involuntary disclosure to neighbours , which might have reduced some aspects of QOL [ 19 ] .
Other explanations such as challenges with starting ART per se , including the treatment associated stigma we found in an earlier study [ 23 ] and the issue of being dependent on life-long regular medicine intake while not being physically very sick , might also play a role .
As opposed to the patients in stage 3 or 4 , who experienced physical improvement , these patients have less clear evidence of the positive side of the medication .
Alternatively , one might perceive that there could be a ceiling effect with the WHOQOL-HIVBREF that might occur in the stage 1 and 2 group , with baseline high QOL .
However , we were surprised that QOL was not higher among this group at baseline and do not think that there was a significant " ceiling effect " in play during this evaluation .
Meanwhile the intervention improved QOL among participants in the group with severe immunosuppression and opportunistic infections , there were no changes regarding internal AIDS-related stigma scores neither in the intervention nor in the subgroup with different clinical stages .
Stigma might be not directly influenced by adherence support measures .
In Vietnam there is a strong association between HIV and " social evils " including IDU and sex work as well as fear of HIV transmission [ 33 ] .
A study carried out in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam revealed that PLHIV often faced problems getting a job , perceived unfair treatment in the work place and experienced discrimination from health care providers [ 34 ] .
The decision to use peer support as an intervention was taken as a result of focus group discussions with patients on ART [ 23 ] when ART was newly implemented in Vietnam and the majority of the participants had been or were severely immunosuppressed with opportunistic infections .
The effect of peer support on QOL improvement depends on the clinical stages of patients as shown by this study .
This randomized controlled trial implemented a common standardized intervention for all patients , independent of clinical staging and severity of disease and , therefore , may have some limitations .
However , the findings indicate a need to develop appropriate intervention tools tailored according to the severity of disease at ART initiation to enable contextualization of the support to different strata of the patient population .
Based on our results , we can not recommend a general peer support intervention but rather an intervention targeted to patients with advanced stages of HIV infection .
While there seem to have been benefits for the patients in stage 3 and 4 , there were no such effects on the patients with less advanced disease .
Possibly similar positive effects could be achieved by support to HIV positive clubs of various kinds , encouraging twinning of patients for those who wish , group support meetings at the hospital etc , rather than organized as the individual resource-intensive process presented in this study .
With such an approach , patients ' needs could be revaluated on a regular basis .
For patients who initiate ART when they are at clinical stage 1 or 2 , adherence support via a mobile phone text message may be considered more appropriate than peer support in some settings , as it might be perceived to interfere less with patient privacy .
This approach has been applied successfully in several other contexts [ 35,36 ] and is now being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in India [ 37 ] .
Our results show that the intervention had a positive effect on QOL among those who were at clinical stages 3 and 4 .
We have not assessed the intervention from a cost effectiveness perspective , but the use of peer-supporters is a comparably low-cost measure , and our recommendation would be for the health system to continue to work with peer-supporters interested in this job , and then to specifically use them for support to patients at clinical stages 3 and 4 , who are starting ART .
A number of other independent factors shown to have an impact on QOL in this study have also been demonstrated by other studies .
For example , people who experience less stigma are more likely to optimistically assess their QOL in general [ 17,18,38 ] .
The relationship between co-infection with hepatitis B and/or C and reduced QOL may be due to the fact that the major symptoms of hepatitis B and C are caused by an immune reaction ; hence , with improved immunocompetence for patients on ART , hepatitis symptoms may be more pronounced [ 39 - 41 ] .
This indicates the need for improved hepatitis management for PLHIV on ART .
Patients who have higher education levels will achieve better QOL [ 10 ] , possibly as they are more integrated in society and may have a better social network of family and friends .
It is difficult to explain why those who witnessed the death of a family member due to HIV had better QOL improvement .
However , it might have been that they valued their own lives and improved health more after the grim experience of losing a family member to HIV [ 42 ] .
Contradicting findings from other studies , the findings in this study did not show that reported intravenous drug use , present or prior , influences QOL in any direction [ 12,43 ] .
This study had some limitations .
For example , factors such as employment , income and marital status were only collected at baseline and might not have accurately reflected the influence of these factors on QOL if they changed over time .
Other limitations may include a rather high withdrawal rate ( 17 % ) and the potential contamination which may have resulted in over or underestimating the effect of the intervention on QOL .
However , as the withdrawal rate was similar in the two groups and patients were randomized , these potential effects can be presumed to be similar in the intervention and control groups .
By randomizing the 71 communes , to increase the geographical spread , we assumed that the risk for contamination was decreased or at least less common as compared to an individual randomization design .
The main objective of the DOTARV project was to assess whether peer support can improve patients ' adherence to ART and decrease treatment failure rates .
Adherence could be an influencing factor of QOL in either positive or negative way .
Increased adherence could result in greater suppression of the virus and result in increased quality of life [ 14,15 ] or greater adherence might be associated with increased adverse effects of medications resulting in decreased quality of life [ 31 ] .
As this is an ongoing cohort that continues to be followed , it may be possible to assess the co-variation of QOL , adherence and clinical outcomes of the intervention at a later stage .
A potential weakness of our study is the fact that a Minimal Clinically Important Difference ( MCID ) has not been established for the WHOQOL-HIVBREF instruments used .
While studies on QOL in relation to HIV and ART are now appearing from different contexts in both low- and middle- income countries , there are clearly contextual differences in indicators , dependent on country of study [ 44 ] .
Hence , we hope our results will contribute to the further development of this research area .
BODY.CONCLUSIONS : The peer support intervention improved QOL after 12 months follow up for patients who were enrolled on ART with severely immunosuppressed condition ( clinical stages 3 and 4 ) but had no impact on QOL improvement for patients enrolled with mild or no clinical symptoms ( clinical stages 1 and 2 ) .
Neither had the intervention any effect on Internal AIDS-related stigma .
To improve QOL for PLHIV on ART , measures to support adherence should be contextualized in accordance with the individual clinical and social needs of the patient .
