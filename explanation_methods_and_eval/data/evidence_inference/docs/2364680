TITLE : Abdominal Wound Problems After Hysterectomy With Electrocautery vs. Scalpel Subcutaneous Incision ABSTRACT : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between postoperative abdominal incision problems and opening subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery or scalpel .
Women scheduled for elective abdominal hysterectomy who gave informed consent were randomly assigned to subcutaneous abdominal wall tissue incision by electrocautery or scalpel .
Postoperative abdominal wound problem diagnoses included seroma , hematoma , infection , or dehiscence without identifiable etiology .
Fifteen of 380 women ( 3.9 % ) developed a wound problem ; six had scalpel and nine had electrosurgical subcutaneous incisions ( P = 0.4 ) .
Thicker subcutaneous tissues ( P = 0.04 ) and concurrent pelvic infection ( P < 0.001 ) were significant risk factors for postoperative wound problems .
Only two women ( 0.5 % ) developed an infection .
We conclude that the method of subcutaneous tissue incision was unrelated to the development of postoperative abdominal incision problems in 380 women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy .
