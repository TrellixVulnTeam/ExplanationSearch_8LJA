TITLE : Effects of neurofeedback training on the brain wave of adults with forward head posture ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of neurofeedback training on electroencephalogram changes in the cervical spine in adults with forward head posture through x-ray .
[ Subjects and Methods ]
The subjects of the study were 40 college students with forward head posture , randomly divided into a neurofeedback training group ( NFTG , n=20 ) and a control group ( CG , n=20 ) .
The neurofeedback training group performed six sessions of pottery and archery games , each for two minutes , three times per week for four weeks , while using the neurofeedback system .
[ Results ] There were significant effects within and between groups in terms of the Delta wave , the Theta wave , the Alpha wave , the Beta wave , or the sensory motor rhythm .
Especially , the Delta wave , Beta wave , and the sensory motor rhythm were showed significant effects between the groups .
[ Conclusion
] It is thought that neurofeedback training , a training approach to self-regulate brain waves , enhances concentration and relaxation without stress , as well as an increase in attention , memory , and verbal cognitive performance .
Therefore an effective intervention method to improve neck pain and daily activities .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Owing to the prevalence and popularity of computers , students and workers are increasingly experiencing musculoskeletal abnormalities in their neck and shoulders1 ) .
Using computers and smart phones for many hours , coupled with lack of exercise , may cause stiffness of the muscles in the neck and shoulders , inducing weakness in the soft tissues .
Such postural and lifestyle habits lead to forward head posture ( FHP ) , which can cause relative compensation such as increased lordosis in the junction of the skull and neck , and abnormal , consistent muscular contraction inducing changes in the craniocervical junction2 ) .
Attention is a basic cognitional function necessary for learning and information processing , and it serves as a basic ability essential for educational activity , information acquisition , and social adjustment3 ) .
Attention and memory are the most basic elements of human cognition ; issues with either may affect the seamless acquisition of new information and consistent performance in learning and tasks4 ) .
Posture affects people in terms of psychological , physical , structural , and functional changes .
Specifically , bad posture is thought to increase the possibility of a decline in learning efficiency , attention , and memory .
The collum and the brain , in particular , are closely situated in terms of anatomical structures .
According to previous research , FHP may induce a reduction in proprioceptive sensibility , in addition to interference between the nerves and the muscles .
These problems may , in turn , affect an individual 's mind and emotions5 ) .
Neuro-feedback ( NFB ) is a type of brain training — based on biofeedback — in which brainwaves are induced and feedback of the induction is provided so that users can control their own brainwaves .
It has been researched in various fields , including brain activation training for the elderly and training for sports requiring concentration , such as golf , archery , and shooting6 ) .
Learning processes , thought , and activity are controlled by cerebral functions , which depend on the activities of many cranial nerves .
These activities can be identified with the help of electroencephalogram ( EEG ) .
When compared to other neuroimaging techniques for research , the EEG is a short-term , noninvasive method that directly shows changes in cerebral function .
From a cost perspective , it has the advantage of being able to provide various useful data based on a short-term test .
In this study , a neuro-feedback training program to a study sample with unstable postures and identified the influence of neuro-feedback training program on the subjects by means of an EEG , on the assumption that the FHP was due to malalignment of the cervical joints and was possibly affecting the subjects ' attention .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : The subjects of this study were students from a university located in Gyeongsangbuk-do , South Korea , whose cervical lordosis angle was 21 ° or less7 ) , whose anterior weight bearing ( AWB ) of the head was 15 mm or more8 ) , and whose cervical extension range of motion ( ROM ) was 70 ° or less .
They understood the purpose and method of the study , and voluntarily provided consent before the experiment .
Those who were periodically undergoing treatment or taking drugs for pain reduction , and those with neurological problems were excluded from the experiment .

All patients understood the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki .
The subjects were randomly divided into a neuro-feedback group and a control group , and underwent a radiographic check and a nondestructive inspection ( NDI ) .
After a four-week application of intervention three times per week for each group , the subjects underwent another radiographic check and NDI .
Neuro-feedback training was applied to the neuro-feedback group using the Neuro-Feedback System ( Braintech Corp. , Korea ) developed by the Korean Research Institute of Jungshin Science .
The training was performed in a place where light and noise were blocked .
After taking a rest for ten minutes , each subject wore a headband in such a way that the FPz , as the center electrode , adhered to the middle of the forehead above the prefrontal region , and the reference electrode adhered to the left earlobe .
As a training exercise for improving attention , the subjects performed a cup-making game and a mind arrow game .
In the cup-making game , the subject had to collect glass pieces to make a cup ; the more cups made , the higher the score .
When the brainwaves were stable enough to satisfy the training conditions , a signal sound indicated that a cup was complete .
If the brainwaves were unstable , the program stopped .
The game was performed six times for two minutes each time .
The mind arrow was a game of archery using brainwaves .
When the brainwaves of the subject satisfied the training conditions and a signal sound was made , the subject could shoot an arrow with the aim of hitting the target in the center .
Fifteen arrows could be shot for two minutes , and the total score indicated the results of the brainwave training after six sessions , each lasting twelve minutes .
Radiographic inspection was conducted to identify the following : the absolute rotation angle (ARA)9 ) for measuring lordosis of the neck ; anterior weight bearing (AWB)10 ) to investigate forward head posture ; and range of flexion and extension motions(PFEM)11 ) to identify the angle of flexion and extension .
In general , it is the brainwaves of the frontal lobe that are used for recording purposes .
In this study , we measured the Delta ( δ ) wave , the Theta ( θ ) wave , the Beta ( β ) wave , and the sensory motor rhythm ( SMR ) for recording purposes .
We followed the international 0–20 system to locate scalp electrodes for the brainwave recording .
When the total ratio is determined as 50 , the ratio of the electrodes is 20:20:10 between the parietal region and the nasion in a forward direction , between the parietal region and the inion in a rearward direction , and between the parietal region and the upper point of both auricles laterally12 ) .
SPSS 14.0 for Windows was used to statistically process the data in this study .
An independent t-test was performed for pretest-posttest within-group comparison and for pretest-posttest difference comparison between the groups .
For level of statistical significance , p=0.05 .

BODY.DISCUSSION : Jang13 ) reported that neuro-feedback training using brainwaves may generate positive brainwaves due to the force of one 's will to feedback one 's own physical reactions with a view to modifying behavior .
Brainwave examination by EGG is a noninvasive method that displays functional changes in the cerebrum and provides various useful data within a short time14 ) .
A β wave faster than 13 Hz is activated when a normal person is excited or concentrates on a certain task , and this is usually displayed in the frontal and parietal regions .
The SMR becomes predominant when a person pays attention to a relatively simple task , while the activities of the sensory motor cortex are minimized without physical movement .
The α wave is a basic brainwave reflecting the stability of the brain , and it can be observed when the balance of brain activities is focused or attention is needed .
Conversely , the β wave is prominent when a person is experiencing worry or anxiousness .
The δ wave is induced , not in a conscious state but in an unconscious state , and it is associated with intuition .
As seen in a patient with a head injury , the δ wave in an arousal state slows down data processing in the brain to interrupt conscious activities15 ) .
Penistone15 ) reports that regular relaxation or meditation training may reduce the low frequency potential and increase the activation potential of the α wave to induce a stable mentality .
In this study , the neuro-feedback training group showed significant increases in the δ wave , the θ wave , the α wave , the β wave , and the SMR after the intervention , while the control group showed no significant increase .
As for the pretest-posttest difference comparison between the groups , significant differences were observed in the δ wave , the β wave , and the SMR .
After the intervention , the neuro-feedback training group showed significant changes in the α wave and the δ wave , indicating that their attention was enhanced because the brainwaves were stabilized by the brain training .
The results of this study were supported by Penistone15 ) in research reporting that regular relaxation or meditation training increases the activation potential of the α wave to induce a stable state of the brain .
The θ wave and the β wave also showed significant changes in the neuro-feedback training group , results that were similar to those of Lee16 ) who reported a reduced θ wave in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe after training , and those of Seo and Park17 ) , in which cognitive anxiety declined and attention increased in normal people when training to maximum performance competency .
Such changes may be common characteristics of brainwave types inducing increased mental attention .
In the performance of a task , the θ wave and the β wave tended to be reduced , indicating an increase in attention and favorable achievement14 ) .
Sterman18 ) reports that the SMR is closely related to attention and indicates that an increase in the SMR may induce changes to a state of attention .
The results of this study are similar to those of Sterman .
In this context , neuro-feedback training may be helpful in stress relaxation , enhancement of attention , and a more stable , efficient state of brain functions that will optimize brain performance .
In this study , brainwave changes by means of neuro-feedback training in adults with forward head posture ( FHP ) .
After the neuro-feedback training , the subjects showed significant increases in the δ wave , the θ wave , the α wave , the β wave , and the SMR .
FHP induces muscular tension and malalignment of the cervical structures , causing stress and a decline in attention due to transformation of the body structure .
Our assumption was that after the neuro-feedback training , the subjects with FHP might experience a stable mentality and relaxation without stress , as well as an increase in attention , memory , and verbal cognitive performance .
We sought to verify these assumptions based on changes in their brainwaves during the training .
Although direct effects on attention were not measured in this study , it might be said that the training positively affected attention .
Consistent studies may be needed in the future to identify various methods for measuring brainwaves in many parts of the brains of patients with different disorders .
