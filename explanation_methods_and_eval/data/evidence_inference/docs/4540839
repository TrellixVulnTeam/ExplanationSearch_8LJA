TITLE : The effects of plantar flexor static stretching and dynamic stretching using an aero-step on foot pressure during gait in healthy adults : a preliminary study ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ]
The aim of this study was to examine whether plantar flexor static stretching and dynamic stretching using an Aero-Step results in changes in foot pressure during gait in healthy adults .
[ Subjects ] Eighteen normal adults were randomly allocated to either a dynamic stretching using an Aero-Step group ( DSUAS ) group ( n = 8) or a static stretching ( SS ) group ( n = 10 ) .
[ Methods ]
The DSUAS and SS participants took part in an exercise program for 15 minutes .
Outcome measures were foot plantar pressure , which was measured during the subject 's gait stance phase ; the asymmetric ratio of foot pressure for both feet ; and the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) measured during the interventions .
[ Results ] There were significant differences in the asymmetric ratio of foot pressure for both feet and VAS between the two groups after intervention .
However , there were no significant differences in foot plantar pressure during the gait stance phase within both groups .
[ Conclusion ] DSUSAS is an effective stretching method , as pain during it is lower than that with SS , which can minimize the asymmetric ratio of foot pressure for both feet during gait due to asymmetric postural alignment .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Most people warm up before exercising .
However , the proper amount of warm-up exercise required has been a subject of debate .
An active warm-up is known to improve an athlete 's performance ability .
Stretching is one component of warming up that improves muscle flexibility , prevents muscle damage , and improves physical performance1,2,3 ) .
Problems mainly occur in the lower limbs , and pain and limitations in joint working force mostly occurs in the ankle joints .
Practitioners report that loss of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion ( ADFROM ) causes hind foot pronation as compensation , followed by altered patellofemoral tracking and finally ; anterior knee joint pain4 , 5 ) .
In addition , limitations in gastrocnemius extensibility cause limitations in ankle dorsiflexion during stance phase of gait , as well as compensatory movements6 , 7 ) .
Therefore , it is important to maintain ADFROM , as a loss of it causes stress and pain to concentrations in the knee , hips , and lower back4 , 8) .
Traditionally , therapists have been evaluated a patient 's soft tissue flexibility to apply the proper intervention before treatment .
In addition , they have used static stretching ( SS ) to maintain and extend the lengths of connective tissues4 ) .
In fact , SS causes pain during its application in the clinic .
Moreover , SS prevents contracture of the joints , increases mobility , and improves muscle flexibility .
However , recent research studies insist it is hard to reduce damage occurrence9 ) .
On the other hand , dynamic stretching allows for movement of the extremities to the end range of the joint in a neutral position .
It also allows for the maximum stretch of muscles at the end range of joints and causes the limb to return to the original position .
This dynamic action is repeated with a slow and naturally controlled motion for a specific duration of time1 ) .
There are two opinions in the existing studies .
One is positive and states that SS helps reduce the injury ratio and helps in recovery ?
The other is negative and states that SS has little influence on injury prevention and negatively influences body performance after stretching1 , 10,11,12 ) .
This means dynamic stretching can be recommended , as it can be a substitute for a warm-up after stretching .
Moreover , dynamic stretching can have a more positive influence on body performance compared with SS when applied immediately after stretching .
Therefore , stretching is necessary for damage prevention .
However , there are different strengths and weaknesses depending on the stretching methods , as well as various opinions on supplementing them .
Therefore , this study aimed to apply a new method of dynamic stretching on an unstable plane to improve foot proprioception , as well as to induce a potential change in the neuromuscular recruitment pattern around the lower extremity13 ) .
In addition , the weakness of SS , including pain and decreased motor performance ability , were avoided in the new method to confirm the effect on foot pressure and gait and determine an efficient stretching method .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : This study utilized 18 adult subjects ( 11 males and 7 females ) who could walk normally without any abnormalities in the musculoskeletal system or neurology that could affect gait .
The study was approved by the Kangwon National University Institutional Review Board .
Before the experiment began , the subjects were informed in detail about the purpose and methods of the experiment , and they agreed voluntarily to participate in the experiment .
A homogeneity analysis of the two groups showed no significant difference .
The average age , height , and weight of the dynamic stretching using Aero-Step ( DSUAS ) group ( n=8 ) and the SS group ( n=10 ) were 29.50 ± 2.36 years , 169.8 ± 6.14 cm , and 63.60 ± 11.29 kg ; and 30.28 ± 2.81 years , 171.00 ± 7.571 cm , and 66.14 ± 12.96 kg , respectively .
Before the interventions , the subjects were measured for foot pressure during gait using a Gait AnalyzerTM ( Tech Storm Inc. , Boryeong , Republic of Korea ) .
They were randomly allotted to the SS group and DSUAS group .
For SS , this study used a Slant Board ( Rivers Edge Products , USA ) , which can be adjusted to different angles , set at 30 ° .
The subjects stretched for 15 min continuously .
The subjects were asked to maintain their pelvis in a neutral position .
This study allowed leaning against a wall when fatigued by long the SS of standing .
If a subject claimed to be experiencing pain in the lower limbs or any discomfort , the intervention was stopped immediately .
For DSUAS , an Aero-Step XL ( Togu , Prien-Bachham , Germany ) was used to provide an unstable base during performance of the exercise program .
The Aero-Step was 51 cm in length , 37 cm in width , and 8 cm in height .
It is composed of soft rubber and two compartments filled with air .
The exercise program included the following exercises .
For 15 min , three movements were performed for 5 min each13 ) .
Foot plantar pressure was measured during the subject 's gait stance phase .
The foot area is divided into 10 areas , including F1 ( fourth and fifth toes ) , F2 ( third and second toes ) , F3 ( first toe ) , F4 ( outer forefoot ) , F5 ( middle forefoot ) , F6 ( inner forefoot ) , R3 ( outer middle foot ) , R4 ( inner middle foot ) , R1 ( outer heel ) , and R2 ( inner heel ) .
The collected pressure information was analyzed using the Gait Analyzer application software ( ver .
3.1)14 ) .
After the interventions , the asymmetric ratio of both foot pressures ( ARFP ) was calculated by putting the foot pressure values of both feet in the following formula : ARFP = | 1 − ( lesser foot pressure ( right or left ) / greater foot pressure)| .
A large absolute value indicates good asymmetry , and vice versa15 ) .
This study measured the level of pain using the Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) during the interventions .
The collected data were analyzed using PASW for Windows ( ver .
18.0 ) .
To compare the changes generated by the two interventions ( dynamic stretching and SS ) , this study used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test .
The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the two interventions at the significance level of ( α ) = 0.05 .
BODY.RESULTS : The foot pressures of the subjects were measured , and then the results were compared .
Both DSUAS and SS showed no significant difference in each region ( p>0.05 ) .
Comparison of the VAS scores showed that there was a significant difference between the DSUAS and SS groups .
In addition , there was a significant difference in ARFP between the groups after the interventions ( p<0.05 ) ( Table 1Table 1.Between-group comparisons of VAS scores and ARFPsDSUASStatic stretchingz aVAS0.62±0.916.00±1.150.00*ARFP0.10±0.040.16±0.03−2.43*aBetween-group comparison .

BODY.DISCUSSION : Acute stretching generates an analgesic effect that improves injured athletes ' performances by minimizing muscular inhibition caused by pain3 ) .
The previous studies , which analyzed the effect of stretching using neurophysiological and mechanical factors , indicates that stretching techniques allow for neural inhibition through muscle stretching .
In other words , stretching reduces reflex activity and muscle resistance , which causes increased joint range of motion16 ) .
Likewise , the effectiveness , efficiency , and neurophysiological foundations of stretching have been proven through various preceding studies .
Moreover , many earlier studies dealt with SS17 ) ; however , recent studies focus more on dynamic stretching18 ) .
In this study , there was no significant difference in foot pressure between the two stretching groups .
This result is consistent with the previous study that reported reduced performance and disconnected force power immediately after stretching3 ) .
Due to the design of this study , significant changes in foot pressure could not be observed , though acute changes were confirmed after the interventions .
One interesting thing , however , is the decreased mean value of the R4 ( inner middle foot ) region .
An increase in the R4 region is a typical found in individuals with flatfoot .
The reason for the decreased mean value of the R4 region is improvement of the contraction and tightness of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle by the two types of stretching , which increased ankle dorsiflexion .
This result suggests that , the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle could easily transit to a supple and rigid position and maintain the sole 's concavity during the stance phase and push-off phase of gait19 ) .
Meanwhile , the DSUAS group showed a greater decrease in the mean foot pressure in the R4 region compared with the SS group .
This is because DSUAS requires more muscle contraction and induced central programming of muscle contraction/coordination , as well as warm-up activity3 ) .
On the other hand , SS is simply application of passive stretching of the muscles .
Therefore , it could not generate the organic transition of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle between contraction and release during gait .
Therefore , it did not cause as great a reduction in the R4 region as DSUAS .
Meanwhile , this study showed a meaningful change in the ARFPs .
The DSUAS group stretched their muscles on an unstable support plane , which generated increased stimulation of the proprioceptors and mechanoreceptors of the plantar skin and ankle joints13 ) .
As a result , muscle activation occurred from the ankle to the knee and from the knee to the hip ; and improved the postural alignment during gait .
One more interesting thing in this study was that the two groups showed significant differences in pain while stretching .
This result suggests that the pain that occurs during an intervention changes muscle recruitment , and disturbs maintenance of the ideal ( symmetric ) posture .
A previous study reported that the analgesic effect caused by stretching influenced not only pain fibers but also other nerves ( proprioceptive nerve)3 ) .
Therefore , the DSUAS applied in this study can stretch the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle properly , decreasing pressure on the R4 ( inner middle foot ) region and preventing flatfoot .
In addition , it is considered an effective stretching method , as less pain is experienced during it than SS , which can minimize the ARFP during gait due to asymmetric postural alignment .
However , this study was a preliminary study conducted with a small number of healthy subjects .
Therefore , future studies should deal with how to relieve symptoms and improve foot pressure symmetry during the gait of flatfoot patients .
