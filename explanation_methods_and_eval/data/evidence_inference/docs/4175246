TITLE : Effect of Training with Whole Body Vibration on the Sitting Balance of Stroke Patients ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of task-oriented training with whole body vibration ( WBV ) on the sitting balance of stroke patients .
[ Subjects ]
The subjects were 30 stroke patients who were randomly divided into experimental ( n1=15 ) and control ( n2=15 ) groups .
[ Methods ] Subjects in both groups received general training five times per week .
Subjects in the experimental group practiced an additional task-oriented training program with WBV , which was performed for 15 minutes , five times per week , for four weeks .
The center of pressure ( COP ) path length and average velocity were used to assess subjects static sitting balance , and the Modified Functional Reach Test ( MFRT ) was used to assess their dynamic sitting balance .
The paired t-test was performed to test the significance of differences between before and after the intervention .
The independent t-test was conducted to test the significance of differences between the groups .
[ Results ] Following the intervention , the experimental group showed a significant change in MFRT .
[ Conclusion ]
The results of this study suggest that task-oriented training with WBV is feasible and efficacious for stroke patients .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Impaired sitting balance is a common problem for stroke patients1 ) , yet a sitting position is essential for safe execution of a variety of movements2 ) .
Many studies have shown that sitting balance influences functional outcome after a stroke1 ) .
Recovery of sitting balance is therefore a therapeutic goal for most stroke patients3 ) .
Several interventions have been devised to improve balance , including task-oriented training4 ) and treadmill training5 ) .
Dean and Shepherd demonstrated that task-oriented training was effective at improving reach while sitting6 ) .
Recently , whole-body vibration ( WBV ) exercise has been developed as a new modality for physical therapy7 ) .
Previous studies have suggested that WBV exercise increases muscle strength and improves muscular performance and balance8 , 9 ) , and the positive effects of WBV on muscle performance should help to improve balance10 , 11 ) .
WBV acts through repetitive sensorimotor stimulation and therapies with WBV have been conducted for elderly patients as well as patients with cerebral palsy , multiple sclerosis , and stroke12,13,14,15 ) .
Some authors have reported WBV training combined with other physical therapies improves balance16,17,18 ) , and WBV was shown to positively influence the postural control and mobility of chronic hemiparetic stroke patients11 ) .
Recently , studies have emphasized the importance of sitting balance for stroke patients and have recommended various balance training methods for its improvement .
However , physical therapies for improved sitting balance are underpinned by little empirical evidence19 ) .
Some studies have focused on the use of WBV , but no study has been conducted to verify the effects of WBV for stroke patients in the sitting position .
Therefore , we investigated the effects of task-oriented training with WBV on the sitting balance of stroke patients .
We hypothesized that a group of stroke patients performing task-oriented training with WBV would show greater improvement of sitting balance than a control group that performing task-oriented training alone .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : The subjects were chronic stroke inpatients of the D Rehabilitation hospital .
The inclusion criteria were history and clinical presentation ( hemiparesis ) of stroke ( > 6 month post-event ) ; ability to sit independently for at least 10 minutes ; no participation in any balance training program during the previous six months ; no orthopedic problems , such as a fracture , deformity , or severe osteoarthritis ; and sufficient cognitive ability to participate in the training : Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE-K ) scores of 21 or higher .
The exclusion criteria were comorbidity or disability other than stroke , and an uncontrolled health condition for which vibration is contraindicated .
Participation in the study was voluntary and the subjects fully understood the contents of this study .
After providing an explanation of the study purpose , as well as the experimental method and processes , written informed consent to participation in the study was obtained from all the subjects .
The study was approved by the Daejeon University institutional review board .
Static sitting balance was evaluated using analysis of center of pressure ( COP ) .
Subjects sat , with their feet unsupported , on a Wii Balance Board ( Nintendo , Kyoto , Japan ) and were asked to keep their arms folded across their chests .
Their thighs were kept parallel , with 75 % of their length supported on the Wii Balance Board .
Data were acquired at 100 Hz , and the mean value of three measurements collected over 30 seconds was used .
COP total path length and average velocity were the outcome measures used in this study .
Higher values indicate lower balance ability20 ) .
Dynamic sitting balance was assesed using the Modified Functional Reach Test ( MFRT ) .
This was performed using a level yardstick mounted on a wall at the height of each subject 's acromion of the nonparetic side , while sitting on a chair with no back or arm rests .
The subjects were seated with their hips , knees , and ankles positioned at 90 ° of flexion , with their feet positioned flat on the floor .
Three measurements were made under each of the following conditions : ( 1 ) sitting with the nonparetic side near the wall and leaning forward , ( 2 ) sitting with the back to the wall and leaning toward the nonparetic side , and ( 3 ) sitting with the back to the wall and leaning toward the paretic side .
The subjects were instructed to lean as far as possible in each direction without rotating or touching the wall .
The furthest position of the fifth finger was marked on the yardstick .
If the patient could not raise the paretic arm , the distance covered by the acromion during leaning was used .
Thirty people fulfilled the inclusion criteria and voluntarily agreed to participate in this study .
The participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group ( n1 = 15 ) or the control group ( n2 = 15 ) .
Both groups received conventional therapy .
The intervention comprised 4 weeks of inpatient treatment .
Both groups performed one session ( 15 minutes ) a day ( 5 days/week ) of task-oriented training in the sitting position .
The experimental group received WBV during task-oriented training ( Galileo Pro ; Novotec Medical GmbH , Germany ) .
The control group performed only task-oriented training .
The WBV frequency ( 15–22 Hz ) and amplitude ( 0–5.8 mm ) were adjusted relative to subjects ' physical abilities10 ) .
Participants were instructed not to hold onto the table during training .
The four exercise tasks were ( 1 ) sitting alone at a table and correcting body alignment ; ( 2 ) reaching in different directions for objects located beyond arm 's length using the nonparetic side ; ( 3 ) reaching in different directions for objects located beyond arm 's length using the paretic side ; and ( 4 ) a bilateral reaching task , such as throwing a ball , lifting a box , and inserting a ring .
Each exercise session was 15 minutes in duration , and subjects practiced each of the four tasks for 3 minutes with a 1-minute rest in between .
Investigators supervised each session and were responsible for ensuring that the amount and intensity of the exercise at each exercise station was graded to each subject 's level of functioning .
All collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 18.0 .
The independent t-test was used to compare differences between group means and changes in values , and the paired t-test was used to test differences in continuous variables within groups .
Differences between categorical variables were analyzed using the χ2 test .
Statistical significance was accepted for values of p<0.05 .
BODY.RESULTS : All patients completed the intervention and assessments .
There were no significant differences in gender , paretic side , age , weight , height or duration of onset between the groups ( Table 1Table 1.General characteristics of subjectsExperimental group(n1=15)Control group(n2=15)GenderMale/Female9/67/8Paretic sideRight/Left6/95/10Age (year)62.8±9.0 * 65.1±15.7Weight (kg)63.3±6.258.0±9.0Height (cm)162.7±6.2161.1±6.5Duration (month)13.0±5.412.6±5.7*Mean±SD ) .

There were no significant differences in non-paretic and paretic reach in the control group .
Differences in total length of COP between pre- and post-intervention differed significantly between the two groups ( p<0.05 ) .
BODY.DISCUSSION : In this study we investigated the effect of task-oriented training with WBV on the sitting balance of stroke patients .
Average velocity and total path length of COP sway were used to evaluate the static balance of the sitting position .
Force platforms have previously been used to investigate the balance control of unsupported sitting of post-stroke individuals through analysis of the COP sway21 , 22 ) .
Previous research reported that a leg exercise with WBV group and a leg exercise group without WBV showed similar improvements in the average velocity of COP in a standing position23 ) with no significant difference between them .
These results were similar to our present results , as we found no significant differences in average velocity or total path length of COP sway between the groups .
It is possible that the training was not sufficiently intense or long enough to elicit improvements in the subjects ; it is also possible that the sensitivity of the assessment method was insufficient .
In the current study , the MFRT was used to evaluate improvements in dynamic balance in the sitting position .
The average anterior and lateral reach distances of adults between 60 and 70 years old are 346 mm and 206 mm , respectively24 ) .
In our study , the anterior , nonparetic , and paretic reach of both groups were below the normal averages at pretest , indicating that both groups had impaired sitting balance .
However , at posttest , the experimental group showed significant improvements ( p<0.05 ) in the anterior , nonparetic , and paretic reach , demonstrating that task-oriented training with WBV in a sitting position is a useful intervention for improving the dynamic sitting balance of stroke patients .
Vibration is a useful method for stimulating proprioception and is capable of long-lasting postural improvement25 ) .
Other effects of vibration include modification of correcting movements and increased postural sway .
The applications of vibration and predictability of stimuli can influence the physiologic effects26 ) .
The control group showed significant improvements ( p<0.05 ) only in anterior reach .
This demonstrates that task-oriented training is a useful intervention for improving anterior reach while sitting .
In the experimental group , the horizontal sinusoidal wave of WBV effectively improved side reach .
Our study suggests that task-oriented training with WBV in the sitting position has beneficial effects on some aspects of sitting balance of chronic stroke patients .
We anticipate that this training method will be used in physical therapy at stroke patient care centers as it is an effective form of training for balance functions .
Further research is needed with larger numbers of subjects to confirm and generalize our present findings .
