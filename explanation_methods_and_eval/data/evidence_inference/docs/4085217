TITLE : The Effect of Underwater Gait Training on Balance Ability of Stroke Patients ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of underwater treadmill gait training on the balance ability of stroke patients .
[ Subjects ] Twenty-two patients with stroke were randomly assigned to an underwater treadmill group ( n = 11 ) or a control group ( n = 11 ) .
[ Methods ]
Both groups received general rehabilitation for 30 min per session , 5 times per week , over a 4-week period .
The underwater treadmill group received additional underwater gait training for 30 min per session , 5 times per week , over the same 4-week period .
Static and dynamic balances were evaluated before and after the intervention .
[ Results ]
The means of static and dynamic balance ability increased significantly in both groups , but there was no significant difference between the two groups .
[ Conclusion ]
Compared to the general rehabilitation program , underwater treadmill gait training was not more effective at improving the balance ability of stroke patients than land-based training .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Balance is the ability to move without falling down or maintain posture , and includes the static stability to maintain a given position with minimum fluctuation , and the dynamic stability to move from a given position without a loss of balance1 ) .
Because stroke patients have difficulty in controlling their movements due to muscle weakness , abnormal muscle tone and abnormal movement patterns , their movement amounts are reduced2 ) , and their body sway increases approximately 2-fold compared to the static standing posture of normal subjects ; their stability limits are also decreased3,4,5 ) .
If body sway increases in a static posture , the weight is loaded asymmetrically on both lower extremities and the ability to move the center of gravity toward the paralytic side is decreased4 ) .
The bias of the weight has a direct influence on instability of gait , and decreases gait speed and increases the risk of falls ; approximately 25 % of stroke patients will be injured in a fall6 ) .
Stroke patients use an abnormal postural control strategy due to their inability to control posture and the asymmetry of balance during task performance7 ) .
Therefore , the focus of functional recovery for stroke patients should be balance ability and the improvement of functional movements8 ) .
Underwater exercises can easily enhance muscular strength and muscular endurance , as well as extend the range of motion , and improve the equilibrium capacity and cardiovascular ability by reducing body weight through buoyancy9 , 10 ) .
In addition , because it is possible to more stably perform exercises underwater than out-of-water , underwater exercises can provide larger benefits by improving mental stability and self-confidence in training11 ) .
Improvement of exercise capacity and stability can enhance the quality of life12 ) .
Underwater exercises for the elderly help improve their cognitive function , psychological stability , and postural stability , which could prevent falls13,14,15 ) .
In recent years , in the rehabilitation of stroke patients , underwater exercises have been used for gait training13 ) .
Underwater , it is possible to perform gait with less difficulty with supporting body weight .
Underwater gait training , which is underwater gait combined with a treadmill compels patients to walk at a regular speed , and it may could have the same effect as treadmill training on the ground9 , 16 ) .
The most important thing in the rehabilitation of the disabled suffering from central nervous system damage is to enable them to move by themselves , and to conduct re-education of functional movements through repetitive motor learning .
Rehabilitation exercises in the water have been studied in recent years to improve the range of abnormal joint motions , or the degree of muscular strain and functional movements , using a range of natural water and active movements , in contrast with exercises on the ground .
Underwater treadmill gait training combines treadmill training with underwater gait to encourage subjects to walk rhythmically at a constant speed17 ) , and it can achieve the same outcomes as treadmill training on the ground15 , 16 ) .
Underwater treadmill gait training resulted in significant improvements in the stance phase of the lower extremity on the affected side , weight support , and psychological stability compared to out-of-water treadmill gait training , and it was suggested that underwater treadmill gait training is more effective at helping stroke patients to recover their ability to walk than out-of-water treadmill gait training18 ) .
Also , underwater treadmill gait , which places a load on the paralyzed ankle of hemiplegic patients , provides stability in the stance phase by reducing hip flexion and hip abduction can improve and the support rate of the lower extremities and the dynamic equilibrium capacity17 ) .
The effects of underwater gait training on patients with stroke have been reported mostly for comprehensive underwater exercise programs .
There are few experimental studies focusing on underwater treadmill gait training as a balance promotion exercise alone .
Therefore , this study examined the impact of on hemiplegic stroke patients ' balance of underwater treadmill gait training to provide basic clinical data for underwater treadmill gait training .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Forty stroke patients at more than six months and less than two years since stroke onset who were admitted to a rehabilitation hospital in Incheon were enrolled in this study .
The subjects included those who could move at least 10 m with the help of an assistive instrument or a person .
Those who had cardiovascular disease , such as cardiac failure or arrhythmia , those who were receiving medical treatment that would have affected their abilities , those with a pulse rate of more than 100 beats per minute at rest or a systolic blood pressure of more than 180 mmHg or a relaxation blood pressure of more than 110 mmHg , and those who could not understand verbal instructions due to serious perception impairment , cognitive impairment , or communication disability etc . or could not use the evaluation equipment were excluded .
This study was conducted after receiving approval from the Ethics Committee of Sahmyook University .
All subjects were provided with information regarding the process , study purpose , and all agreed in writing to participate in the study19 , 20 ) .
A total of 22 patients from the 40 enrolled subjects were selected as subjects for this study .
The 18 exclusions included 10 who could not walk independently , five with cognitive disabilities , and three who declined to participate in the experiment .
To minimize selection bias , the 22 selected subjects were randomly assigned to the underwater treadmill group ( 11 subjects ) or the control group ( 11 subjects ) .
Subjects ' general characteristics , static balance ability , and dynamic balance ability were examined prior to the intervention .
The two groups participated in a 30-min general rehabilitation program which was conducted by a physical therapist , 5 times per week .
Underwater treadmill training was conducted for 30 min twice a week for the underwater treadmill group .
In addition , warm-up and cool-down exercises were carried out for five minutes at the start and end of each workout at the end of the 4-week intervention , the subjects ' static balance and dynamic balance were evaluated again .
Subjects were excluded from the analysis if their participation rate was less than 80 % .
In the underwater treadmill group , one patient was discharged for personal reasons , and 10 subjects received the post-test .
In the control group , one was injured in an accident caused by a fall , and 10 subjects received the post-test .
Therefore , the study sample comprised 10 people in the underwater treadmill group and 10 people in the control group .
The general rehabilitation program was composed of motor exercise ( ME ) , functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) , and occupational therapy ( OT ) .
The motor exercises were performed five times a week , once per day , for 30 minutes .
The motor exercises consisted of postural control , gait training , and balance training .
The program was conducted taking into consideration patients ' levels for development of the central nervous system .
Muscular strength training was carried out using the apparatus for 30 minutes .
FES was applied to the upper and lower extremities for 15 minutes each .
OT was performed for activities of daily living as upper extremity training , five times per week , once a day for 30 minutes each time21 ) .
The underwater treadmill gait program began with a warm-up in the water for 5 minutes to establish psychological stability and prevent accidents .
The main exercise was carried out for 30 minutes .
At the end of the main exercise , cool-down exercises were carried out for 5 minutes including stretching to relax muscle tension and recover muscle fatigue .
Training was performed twice a week for four weeks .
The initial speed of the underwater treadmill training was set at 36 % of each subject 's ground gait speed22 ) .
The speed was increased in increments of by 0.1 m/s , to maintain comfort and good gait patterns , to the maximum ability of the subjects .
The training speed of the next day began at the maximum speed of the previous day23 ) , and the speed was lowered when the alignment of the trunk and limbs was abnormal or the gait was unbalanced due to the treadmill speed being faster than a subject 's ability to comfortably perform gait .
Training was performed twice a week for 30 minutes over a four-week period , and the subjects wore water shoes to prevent slipping on the treadmill foothold .
The pool water temperature for the gait training was 34 Â° C , and the water depth was adjusted to each the patient 's xiphoid17 ) .
In this study , the Hydrophysio-Focus ( Hydrophysio , USA , 2009 ) was used as the underwater treadmill gait training tool .
Hydrophysio-Focus allows easy adjustment of the water depth ( 0â1,280 mm ) to each individual 's height through a touch-screen control panel , and provides hydrokinetic exercise in an environment in which a subject can jump or walk on the underwater treadmill ( 3,500 Ã 1,400 Ã 2,100 mm ) .
The gait speed ( 0.1â8 km/h ) can be adjusted to match a subject 's ability .
In this study , the Balance System SD ( Biodex , USA , 2009 ) was used to evaluate the static balance and dynamic balance .
Static balance and dynamic balance were analyzed .
The Balance System SD consists of a platform and display device , and 12 strain gauges within the platform measure the equilibrium angle of the platform .
The platform can slope up to 20 Â° in all directions , and the mean angle of the slope indicates the stability of static balance .
Static balance is measured by limiting the platform movement to within 5 Â° , whereas platform movement is unlimited in dynamic balance tests .
Balance is scored as anteroposterior , mediolateral and total balance , and the mean slope angle of the platform is calculated ; higher scores indicate lower stability .
The intra-rater reliability of this test is r = 0.80 , and the inter-rater reliability is r = 0.4024,25,26 ) .
The static balance was measured using the postural stability test of the Balance System SD test methods .
The postural stability test assesses total posture sway .
Subjects stood with their feet shoulder-width apart on the platform ( restricted to 5 Â° movement ) and adjusted their balance aiming to keep the cursor within the target displayed on the screen .
The test lasts for 30 seconds and was measured three times with 10-second rest intervals .
The average value of the measurements of anteroposterior postural sway , and the mediolateral postural sway of each leg were calculated24 , 26 ) .
The dynamic balance was measured using the fall risk test of the Balance System SD test methods .
Subjects stood with their feet shoulder-width apart on the freely-pivoting platform and adjusted their balance aiming to keep the cursor within the target displayed on the screen .
The data was collected for 30 seconds , three times , with 10-second rest intervals between measurements .
All statistical analyses of this study were performed using SPSS 17.0 .
The data were normally distributed .
We compared the exercise effect between before and after the intervention in each group using the paired t-test .
The independent t-test was performed to examine the differences between the groups .
A p value < 0.05 was considered significant .
BODY.RESULTS : Twenty subjects were enrolled in this study , and there were no significant differences in the general characteristics of the underwater treadmill group and the control group ( Table 1Table 1 .

In addition , there were no significant differences in the static and dynamic balance abilities of the underwater treadmill group and control group .
In static balance , both the underwater treadmill group and the control group showed significant decreases in anteroposterior , mediolateral and total postural sway after the interventions ( p<0.05 ) .
The comparison of the pre- and post- test results of the two groups found no significant differences ( Table 2Table 2 .

BODY.DISCUSSION : Static balance is the ability to maintain the center of gravity within the limits of stability , and dynamic balance is the ability to adjust the body posture to prevent falls while moving the body27 ) .
The balance is one of the first of the body functions to be restored in stroke patients28 ) .
In this study , the static and dynamic balance abilities of hemiplegic stroke patients were evaluated after underwater treadmill gait training for four weeks .
To determine the changes after the intervention in their static balance ability , anteroposterior , mediolateral , and total postural sway on a fixed stable support surface were measured using balance measuring equipment ( balance system SD , SD 950 - 304 , Biodex , USA ) .
Evaluation of total postural sway was performed on a moving stable support surface to determine the dynamic balance ability of anteroposterior postural sway .
After the interventions , the anteroposterior postural sway of static balance ability of the underwater treadmill group showed a significant difference , with a 41 % decrease compared to pre- training ( p<0.05 ) , and the control group also showed a significant difference , with a 35 % decrease ( p<0.05 ) .
For the mediolateral postural sway , the underwater treadmill group showed a significant difference with a 31 % decrease from pre- training ( p<0.05 ) , and the control group also showed a significant difference with a 31 % decrease ( p<0.05 ) .
Regarding the overall postural sway , the underwater treadmill group showed a significant difference with a 32 % decrease from the pre- and post-training ( p<0.05 ) .
The control group also showed a significant difference with a 29 % decrease ( p<0.01 ) .
The post-intervention comparison of the two groups found no significant differences .
These findings show that underwater treadmill gait training might not have a more significant than land-based training on the static balance ability of stroke patients .
Although a direct comparison was difficult due to different subject characteristics , our results differ from those of previous studies , which have reported improvements in static balance ability after underwater gait training performed by patients with osteoarthritis of the lower limb29 ) .
Giaquinto et al. reported that underwater gait training improved subjects ' the ability to adjust their posture by increasing the information of proprioception and touch sensation , and improving the stability of static balance ability during standing with both feet , by reducing the angular velocity of the center of mass30 ) .
However , stroke patients have abnormal motor and sensory nerves on the paralyzed side of the lower extremity , and the amount of information of proprioception and touch sensation from the water would have been insufficient to induce an improvement in their static balance .
Suomi et al. reported that the condition of a temperature-controlled water exercise may be a factor that helps to improve static balance ability29 ) .
In this study , although our subjects were trained in a relaxed state in a temperature-controlled underwater training environment , the balance test after training was measured at a different temperature .
Therefore , there was the possibility that the different temperatures of the environment , between training and test , affected the static balance ability of our subjects .
In this study , the overall postural sway of dynamic balance ability showed significant differences , with a 31 % reduction in the underwater treadmill group ( p<0.05 ) , and a 42 % reduction in the control group ( p<0.05 ) .
However , the post-intervention comparison of the two groups found no significant differences between them .
Lund et al. reported that the results were statistically significant in 79 patients with osteoarthritis because the underwater gait training group showed a 3 % increase in dynamic balance ability compared to a land-based gait training group , and between pre- and post-training (p<0.05)31 ) .
Jung et al. found a significant increase in dynamic balance ability , due to an increase in weight bearing capacity , after underwater treadmill gait training for stroke patients .
They loaded the paralyzed side ankle of the patients to reduce its buoyancy and to increase its weight bearing capacity in the stance phase ( p<0.05 ) .
The increase in subjects ' dynamic balance ability was considered to have been induced by improvement in the muscular strength of the hip flexors and extensors on the paralyzed side limb , a result of the underwater treadmill gait training , and the reduction of buoyancy , and postural stability was attributed to a 60 % increase in the weight bearing ability in the stance phase17 , 20 , 32 ) .
In the present study , unlike previous studies , both the underwater treadmill group and control group showed significant improvements .
For patients without hemiplegia , underwater gait training would increase dynamic balance ability more than overground gait training due to their balanced weight support .
On the other hand , for our stroke patients , the underwater treadmill gait training was ineffective at improving the dynamic balance ability due to the decrease in weight on the paralyzed side limb which was supported by buoyancy .
