TITLE : The Effects of ISM1 Medium on Embryo Quality and Outcomes of IVF/ICSI Cycles ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : : The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of ISM1 culture medium on embryo development , quality and outcomes of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( IVF/ICSI ) cycles .
This study compares culture medium commonly used in the laboratory setting for oocyte recovery and embryo development with a medium from MediCult .
We have assessed the effects of these media on embryo development and newborn characteristics .
ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : : In this prospective randomized study , fertilized oocytes from patients were randomly assigned to culture in ISM1 ( MediCult , cycles : n=293 ) or routine lab culture medium ( G-1TM v5 ; Vitrolife , cycles : n=290 ) according to the daily media schedule for oocyte retrieval .
IVF or ICSI and embryo transfer were performed with either MediCult media or routine lab media .
Embryo quality on days 2/3 , cleavage , pregnancy and implantation rates , baby take home rate ( BTHR ) , in addition to the weight and length of newborns were compared between groups .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : : There were similar cleavage rates for ISM1 ( 86 % ) vs. G-1TM v5 ( 88 % ) .
We observed a significantly higher percentage of excellent embryos in ISM1 ( 42.7 % ) compared to G-1TM v5 ( 39 % , p<0.05 ) .
Babies born after culture in ISM1 had both higher birth weight ( 3.03 kg ) and length ( 48.8 cm ) compared to G-1TM v5 babies that had a birth weight of 2.66 kg and a length of 46.0 cm ( p<0.001 for both ) .
ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : : This study suggests that ISM1 is a more effective culture medium in generating higher quality embryos , which may be reflected in the characteristics of babies at birth .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : The outcome of an assisted reproduction treatment ( ART ) cycle is highly dependent on numerous factors including the clinic location , equipment and disposables used ( 1 ) , patient age ( 2 , 3 ) , stimulation regimens ( 4 ) , sperm selection ( 5 ) , culture condition ( pH ) ( 6 ) , O2 ( 7 ) , and group culture ( 8) .
It is recommended that the clinic select a suitable culture system that repeatedly produces high quality embryos for embryo transfer and cryo-preservation with low miscarriage rates that results in the delivery of a healthy baby of normal gestational age ( 9 , 10 ) .
In vitro culture and development of human embryos for days 2 or 3 transfers is performed in a variety of different culture media that range from simple to complex ( 11 - 13 ) .
Increased knowledge in the specific requirements for the development of healthy human pre-implantation embryos has resulted in the formulation of new culture media ( 2 , 14 , 15 ) that supports the development of embryos from fertilization to the fully expanded blastocyst stage ( 2 , 16 - 24 ) .
These products are commercially available , their quality is meticulously tested , and they are readyto- use .
Therefore the use of these high quality products should significantly improve embryo quality , cost-efficiency of the treatment , and the clinic 's reputation ( 12 ) .
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficiency of two different commercially available media products ( ISM1 , MediCult , Denmark vs. G-1TM v5 , Vitrolife , Sweden ) in supporting the development of embryos ( days 2 and 3 ) , their ability to implant and deliver a healthy baby at term .
BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.PATIENT POPULATION : This prospective randomized study was performed during a five month period ( February- June , 2009 ) .
During this period all culture conditions , routines and disposables were kept constant in the laboratory .
On the day of oocyte pick up , there were 583 patients randomized to both groups according to a randomization list based on sequential numbers in sealed envelopes .
The ISM1 group ( experimental ) consisted of 293 patients compared to 290 patients in the routine lab procedure group ( control ) .
Depending on the causes of infertility , patients received either standard in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) .
Excluded from the study were patients with previous fertilization failure [ 19 ( experimental ) vs. 8 ( control ) ] ; those with no oocytes retrieved [ 1 ( experimental ) vs. 1 ( control ) ] ; and patients diagnosed with ovarian hyperstimulation hormone syndrome [ OHSS ; 22 ( experimental ) vs. 18 ( control ) ] .
Inclusion criteria were counseling patients undergoing ICSI treatment , between 18 to 40 years of age who had a minimum of 2 follicles ( ≥18 mm ) at the time of oocyte collection .
Patients were randomly assigned to have their fertilized oocytes cultured in ISM1 ( MediCult , cycles : n=293 , written informed consent was taken from all the couples who received this culture medium ) or routine lab procedure ( G-1TM v5 ; vitrolife , cycles : n=290 ) according to the daily medium schedule for oocyte retrieval .
This study was approved by Ethical Committee of Royan Institute .
BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.STIMULATION REGIMES AND OOCYTE RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES : Down regulation and ovarian stimulation were performed in accordance with a previously reported stimulation regimen ( 25 ) .
In brief , pituitary gonadotropin secretion was suppressed with the GnRH agonist buserelin acetate ( Suprefact , Hoechst AG , Germany ) via subcutaneous ( SC ) injection ( 500 mg/d ) or by nasal spray ( 800 mg/d ) starting in the mid luteal phase of the preceding ovarian cycle ( day 21 ) .
Once ovarian suppression was confirmed ( serum E2 ≤50 pg , FSH ≤12 IU and LH ≤5 IU ) , ovarian stimulation was initiated with recombinant FSH ( Gonal F ; SC injection , 150 IU/day , Serono , Switzerland ) .
The dose was adjusted according to the response of the ovarian follicular development and monitored by serial vaginal ultrasonography .
When at least three follicles reached 18 mm in diameter , both GnRH agonist and hMG were discontinued and a single dose of hCG ( 10000 IU ; Pregnyl ; Organon , Netherlands ) was administered .
Oocyte retrieval was performed via vaginal ultrasound- guided follicle aspiration , 36 - 38 hours after administration of hCG .
BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION ( ICSI ) : After egg collection , the cumulus-oocyte complexes were either placed in 50 μL droplets of Universal IVF medium and covered with liquid paraffin ( MediCult , Denmark ) as the experimental group or in 50 μL droplets of Ham 's F-10 , ( Biochrom AG ; Berlin , Germany ) , which had been supplemented with 10 % recombinant human serum albumin ( rHA , Vitrolife ) and covered with pre-incubated mineral oil ( Sigma , St. Louis , MO ) , as the control group .
Oocyte denudation was performed with ICSI Cumulase ( MediCult ) in the experimental group or with 80 IU of hyaluronidase , ( Sigma , USA ) in the control group , two hours after egg collection .
Sperms were immobilized in 10 % PVP droplets ( MediCult ) in the experimental group and in10 % PVP droplets ( Global ) in the control group by breaking the tail by an injection pipette .
Then , a single sperm with head front was injected into each oocyte that had a visible first polar body ( MII ) ( 26 , 27 ) .
All semen samples were prepared by swim-up method .
BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.CONTROL OF FERTILIZATION AND EMBRYO CULTURE :
The fertilization rate was controlled 18 - 20 hours after sperm injection .
Normally fertilized oocytes that had evidence of two pronuclei were washed and transferred to overnight pre-incubated in 20 μl droplets of ISM1 or G- 1TM v5 supplemented with 10 % recombinant human serum albumin in the experimental and control groups respectivly and covered with either pre-incubated liquid paraffin ( experimental group ) or mineral oil ( control group ) .
All cultures incubated at 37 ̊C , in 5 % O2 and 6 % CO2 .
BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.EMBRYO SCORING AND TRANSFER TECHNIQUES : On the day of embryo transfer ( 44 - 72 hours after injection ) , we scored embryo morphology according to the following quality criteria : ExcellentDay 2 : 2 - 4 even size blastomeres with ≤10 % fragmentationDay 3 : 6 - 8 even size blastomeres with ≤10 % fragmentationGoodDay 2 : 2 - 4 even or uneven size blastomeres with 10%-20 % fragmentationDay 3 : 6 - 8 even or uneven size blastomeres with 10%-20 % fragmentationPoorUneven and few blastomeres with > 20 % fragmentation Based upon the embryo quality , female age and number of previous cycles , we selected a maximum of four high quality embryos and incubated them in UTM ( MediCult ) for the experimental group or Embryo Glue ( Vitrolife ) for the control group , for a period of 20 - 120 minutes before embryo transfer .
All embryo transfers were performed with a Labotect catheter ( Labotect , Germany ) against a filled urine bladder with the expertise of gynecologists and embryologists .
BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS :
We used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS 11.5 ; Chicago , IL , USA , http:// www.spss.com ) software to analyze differences amongst the variables of both groups by Chisquare and Fisher 's exact tests for categorical variables or the student 's t test for continuous variables , as appropriate .
A p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
BODY.RESULTS : Patient characteristics of the two groups are summarized in table 1 .
The number of cycles , mean female age , indications for infertility , number of previous treatment cycles , retrieved oocytes and percentage of cleaved embryos were similar in both groups .
There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of cleavage rates , number of embryos transferred , clinical pregnancy and implantation rates and multiple pregnancies .
There were a significantly higher percentage of excellent embryos in the experimental group ( 42.7 % ; ISM1 ) compared to the control group ( 39 % , p<0.05 ) .
There was also a trend towards higher clinical and multiple pregnancy rates as well as implantation rates ( Table 2 ) for the experimental group .
In terms of abortion , the experimental group ( 20.5 % ) was not significantly different from the control group ( 21.1 % ) .
There was no significant difference in baby take home rates ( BTHR ) between both groups , however both the length [ 48.8 cm ( experimental ) vs. 46.0 cm ( control ) ] and weight
[ 3.03 kg ( experimental ) vs. 2.66 kg ( control ) ] of babies born were significantly higher in the expreimental group ( p<0.001 for both parameters ) .

BODY.DISCUSSION : There are a variety of different in vitro culture systems available for laboratory procedures applied to gamete maintenance and embryonic growth .
These media products range from simple solutions to more complex culture media systems , which have been adapted to the changes that the developing embryos face during their passage through the female reproductive tract ( 11 - 13 ) .
Many recent discoveries have been fundamental in describing different biochemical , physiologic , genetic , and epigenetic characteristics of the embryo , resulting in recent innovations in this field .
Culture media formulations are presumed to be of essential importance for normal development of human embryos in the controlled environment of an incubatorin addition to their effects on developing embryos ( 22 , 23 , 28 ) .
A general agreement does not exist regarding the efficacy of different commercially available in vitro culture media , since some studies have reported no differences in embryo quality , pregnancy and implantation rates ( 18 , 21 , 29 ) , whereas others have observed subtle differences in day 3 embryo quality [ G1.2 vs. Sydney IVF sequential media ( 16 ) , G1.2 vs. HTF ( 20 ) and GIII series versus ISM1(30 ) ] .
Several studies have investigated the effect of ISM1 and G-1TM v5 media on embryo quality and implantation rate .
Embryo morphology on days 2 and 3 significantly enhanced when the embryos were cultured in GIII series versus ISM1 ( 18 ) .
Another study showed that " in a day 3 embryo transfer program , G1.2/G2.2 media were superior to Sydney IVF media , whereas both media yielded similar outcomes in blastocyst transfer program " ( 20 ) .
A prospective study on sibling oocytes showed that embryo quality in the day 2 stage improved under ISM1 culture rather than FertiCult culture medium , even if data regarding pregnancy and implantation rate were not reported ( 31 ) .
Another study demonstrated that ISM1 culture medium seemed to improve the performance of embryonic growth and development , as well as increased the percentage of pregnancies ( 32 ) .
For this reason , we conducted a prospective randomized trial at Royan Institute to compare embryo development parameters , IVF outcome and BTHR at the end of the gestational period between ISM1 and G-1TM v5 media , which is used routinely in our laboratory .
The result of the study suggests that both ISM1 and G-1TM v5 support embryo development in vitro , whereas culture in ISM1 gives a higher proportion of excellent quality embryos .
Good embryo quality , cleavage rate , and single , triplet pregnancy rate in the control group were higher than ISM1 medium , but there were no significant differences .
In ISM1 , the implantation , clinical pregnancy and twin pregnancy rates were higher than the G-1TM v5 medium .
However , this difference was not significant .
The percentage of excellent embryos was significantly higher than the control group which might be reflected in the characteristics of babies born .
Babies born after culture in ISM1 had both significantly higher birth weight and were also longer compared to the control group , both of which were significant .
In vivo as well as in vitro fundamental factors for proper embryonic development could be summarized as oxygen consumption , the balance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defense , energetic metabolites ( Na+ , K+ , adenosine triphosphatase ) , and amino acid turnover .
The oxygen requirement appears constant over the course of the early embryonic development phases up to the blastocyst stage , and later increases ( 33 ) .
Although in vivo physiologic reactive oxygen species production is controlled continuously by a strong cellular defense , the lack of this system during the in vitro culture could cause oxidation of proteins , lipids , DNA , and the misregulation of metabolic pathways that may lead to cell death ( 34 - 36 ) .
On the basis of these observations , it can be speculated that the antioxidant elements present in ISM1 culture medium sustain the cultured embryos , thereby avoiding developmental failure and also achieving the best quality embryos for implantation ( 32 ) .
The result of this study has demonstrated that ISM1 medium improved embryo development .
The percentage of excellent embryos was significantly higher in ISM1 medium compared with the control group ( G-1TM v5 ) .
This result was possibly due to the antioxidant elements present in ISM1 culture medium .
Singleton children born after IVF have a significantly lower birth weight compared with their spontaneously conceived peers ( 37 - 39 ) , even after adjustments for maternal age and parity .
This phenomenon has produced concern , because low birth weight is associated with morbidity over both the short and long term ( 40 ) .
Speculations about possible causes , including epigenetic alterations by ovarian stimulation , have been published ( 41 ) .
Theoretically the lower birth weight in IVF singletons could be attributed to i. maternal and/or paternal characteristics associated with infertility ; ii .
the effects of ovarian stimulation on oocytes , endometrium or the endocrinology of the luteal phase or early pregnancy ; or iii .
IVF laboratory procedures such as ICSI or embryo culture conditions ( 42 , 43 ) .
The implementation of suitable quality control has focused on the effectiveness of culture media in improving embryo morphology and it is fundamental to the success of an IVF laboratory ( 44 ) .
" The possible interference of assisted reproduction techniques ( ART ) with epigenetic reprogramming during early embryo development has recently sparked renewed interest about the reported lower birth weight among infants born as a consequence of infertility treatments " ( 45 ) .
Both the shorter duration of pregnancy and the reduced neonatal birth weight could be caused by inactivation of paternal alleles during the imprinting process .
If the shorter duration of pregnancy and the lower birth weight after IVF and ICSI can be attributed to a distinct defect of epigenetic phenomena at work during parental imprinting , then this defect may have later effects on the individual ( 46 , 47 ) and has the potential to be transferred to other generations ( 48 ) .
ISM1 culture medium was formulated to promote correct imprinting for ensuring correct development and implantation ( 32 ) .
As demonstrated by Cassuto et al. ( 49 ) , different timing and culture conditions can have different effects on embryo development and implantation rate .
Extended culture time and particular culture conditions result in an increase in monozygotic twinning .
In this study the use of only ISM1/ISM2 culture conditions resulted in lower monozygotic twin pregnancies , independent of the technology used ( IVF/ICSI ) ( 49 ) .
The result of our study demonstrated that babies born after culture in ISM1 had both higher birth weight and were also longer than those in control group .
This result might be due to correct imprinting that ensured correct development and implantation .
BODY.CONCLUSION : This study suggests that on the one hand ISM1 contains antioxidant elements and on the other hand it is formulated to promote correct imprinting to ensure correct development and implantation .
ISM1 is presumed to be a more effective culture medium that generates higher quality embryos , which is reflected in the characteristics of babies born .
Since numerous factors that include mother 's diabetes and multiple pregnancies , among others may also impact the height and the weight of the newborn , we can not directly relate the change in these two characteristics solely to the culture media .
For reaching a definitive conclusion , additional studies that consider these factors are warranted .
