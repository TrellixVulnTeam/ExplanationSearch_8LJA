TITLE : Effect of gait training with constrained-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) on the balance of stroke patients ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of intensive gait training using a constrained induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) technique applied to the non-paretic upper extremity on the balance ability of stroke patients .
[ Subjects and Methods ] Twenty stroke patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group .
The experimental group received gait training with CIMT for 30 minutes per session , three sessions per week for four weeks , and the control group received gait training alone .
[ Results ]
The experimental group showed improvements in dynamic balance and the degree of improvement in this group was greater than that observed in the control group .
Furthermore , the experimental group showed improvements in movement distances to the paretic side .
On the other hand , the control group showed no significant improvements in balance indices after the intervention .
[ Conclusion ] Gait training of stroke patients using CIMT techniques should be regarded as a treatment that can improve the balance of stroke patients .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Arm swing during walking plays a role in maintaining body balance by inducing rotation of the upper extremity in the opposite direction to the direction of pelvic rotation1 ) .
Stroke patients show arm swing asymmetry which is considered to be due to their low walking velocity and the asymmetric movements of the paretic and non-paretic sides due to an incorrect stance2 , 3 ) .
Reduction or limitation of arm swing due to paralysis excessively increases non-paretic side arm swing leading to reductions in paretic side stride length , stride frequency , and walking velocity .
It also limits thoracic rotation and alters normal movements of the extremities and the trunk , thereby adversely affecting balance control while walking4,5,6 ) .
Constrained-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) is a training method that encourages the use of the paretic upper extremity by suppressing excessive use of the non-paretic upper extremity , and has been reported to be effective at not only enhancing the paretic upper extremity functions of hemiplegia patients , but also at enhancing coordination between the upper and lower extremities7,8,9 ) .
The majority of training courses that utilize CIMT techniques are based on functional training in sitting positions rather than walking , and the major dependent variables used to determine the training effects of CIMT have been associated with movements of the upper extremity during gait6 , 9 , 10 ) .
In fact , no study has investigated whether gait training that directly induces paretic side arm swing by fixing the non-paretic upper extremity during walking improves the balance ability of stroke patients .
Therefore , the present study was conducted to examine the effects of intensive gait training combined with CIMT techniques , to induce paretic side arm swing , on the balance abilities of hemiplegia patients .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Subjects inclusion criteria were : stroke onset of at least three months before the study commencement , a Korean Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE-K ) score of ≥ 24 points , and the ability to walk independently outdoors for at least 30 minutes without an ambulatory aid .
The study exclusion criteria were : a limitation in movement of the non-paretic upper extremity , a visual field defect , problems with the vestibular organ , or an orthopedic medical history of the upper or lower extremity .
From among a total of 151 subjects considered , 20 subjects were selected following the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria .
Before participating in the experiment , all subjects were provided with a comprehensive explanation of the study purpose and method and they voluntarily agreed to participate .
The experiment was approved by the Institutional Bioethics Committee of Daejeon University .
The experimental group received ground gait training , after fixing the non-paretic upper extremity so that it could not move , for 30 minutes per session , three sessions per week for 4 weeks in addition to central nervous system developmental treatment for 60 minutes per session , five times per week , over the same 4 weeks .
The control group received general ground gait training , without fixation of the non-paretic upper extremity , as well as central nervous system developmental treatment for the same number of sessions and duration as those received by the experimental group .
To fix the non-paretic upper extremity , the midpoint between the shoulder joint , and the elbow joint , and the midpoint between the elbow joint and the wrist were fixed to the trunk using Velcro straps to prevent the non-paretic upper extremity from moving .
All subjects in the two groups performed gait training by walking back and forth on a 10 m straight indoor walking path on an even floor a set number of times at speeds which were determined based on subject comfort .
Subjects were instructed to swing the paretic upper extremity to the greatest extent they could .
Rest time was allowed whenever a subject complained of fatigue after which gait training was re-started .
Therapists assisted subjects as required .
To measure balance ability , dynamic balance was measured using a Biorescue ( RM INGENIERIE , Rodez , France ) .
Subjects were instructed to spread their feet to approximately 30 ° and keep their eyes looking forward in an upright standing position .
Before taking measurements , subjects were shown a video of the measuring method and were given a demonstration .
The Trunk Impairment Scale ( TIS ) is used to measure the degree of damage to the trunk and to assess trunk coordination and balance in the sitting position .
The TIS is subdivided into static sitting balance , dynamic sitting balance , and coordination .
Higher scores indicate less trunk damage11 ) .
The maximum limit of stability ( LOS ) is defined as the distance moved by the center of gravity in the standing position when body weight is moved maximally to the paretic and non-paretic sides using ankle strategies without losing balance .
Measurements were taken three times and the results were averaged12 ) .
The χ2 and independent t tests were used to verify group homogeneity .
Wilcoxon 's signed rank test was used to compare results before and after the intervention , and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the experimental and control groups with respect to differences in values before and after intervention .
Statistical significance was accepted for p values < 0.05 .

The experimental group showed an improvement of 28.6 % in dynamic balance as determined by the TIS , and of 34.3 % in movement distances of the paretic side as determined by the LOS , and the changes in dynamic balance were significantly larger in the experimental group than in the control group , which showed no significant improvements in balance ability after gait training .
BODY.DISCUSSION : The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of intensive gait training using a constrained induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) technique for the non-paretic upper extremity on the balance ability of stroke patients .
According to our results , gait training conducted with CIMT improved the dynamic balance of hemiplegic stroke patients by 28.6 % after training , indicating improved trunk stability , and movement distances to the paretic side in the standing position increased by 34.3 % .
Furthermore , the improvements were larger in the experimental group than in the control group .
Stephenson et al.13 ) reported that gait training of stroke patients with the non-paretic upper extremity fixed to treadmill handrails was effective at inducing paretic side arm swing and that training improved upper trunk stabilization , results which are in agreement with our findings .
In the present study , the experimental group showed increases in movement distance to the paretic side .
We consider this was due to fixation of the non-paretic upper extremity , which would have increased the pendulum movement of the paretic upper extremity and conscious attempts to swing the paretic side arm9 ) .
Homogeneity testing of the two groups revealed significant differences in the groups ' ages .
However , our results indicate that the experimental group achieved greater benefits from gait training with CIMT despite having a higher average age .
Therefore , we consider the age difference was not a confounding factor for the results .
The major limitation of the present study was the small number of study subjects , which makes it difficult to generalize our results in the context of proposing an intervention for improving the balance of stroke patients .
However , the results of the present study are meaningful , because it is the first study to investigate the effects of upper extremity CIMT techniques combined with gait training on the balance ability of stroke patients .
Therefore , we suggest that additional studies should be conducted to investigate the levels of upper extremity function and training effects according to movements of the paretic upper extremity to confirm our findings .
Despite the limitations of our study , in our opinion , the method presented in the present study could be applied as a gait training method to improve the balance of stroke patients .
