TITLE : Effect of Ankle-foot Orthosis on Lower Limb Muscle Activities and Static Balance of Stroke Patients Authors ’ Names ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] This study examined the effects of an ankle-foot orthosis worn during balance training on lower limb muscle activity and static balance of chronic stroke patients .
[ Subjects ]
The subjects were twenty-five inpatients receiving physical therapy for chronic stroke .
[ Methods ]
The chronic stroke patients were divided into two groups : thirteen patients were assigned to the ankle-foot orthosis group , while the remaining twelve patients wore only their shoes .
Each group performed balance training for 20 minutes , twice per day , 5 days per week , for 6 weeks .
The lower limb muscle activities of the paralyzed side tibialis anterior , medial gastrocnemius , and the stability index were measured before and after the 6-week intervention .
[ Results ] Comparison of the groups indicated a significant difference in the muscle activity of the paralyzed side tibialis anterior and the stability index of the eyes-open standing position .
After the intervention , the ankle-foot orthosis group evidenced a significant difference in the muscle activities of the paralyzed side tibialis anterior and paralyzed side medial gastrocnemius as well as the stability index of the eyes-open standing position , eyes-closed standing position , eyes-open standing position on a sponge , and eyes-closed standing position on a sponge .
The group that only wore their shoes showed significant differences in the stability indexes of eyes-open standing and eyes-open standing on a sponge .
[ Conclusion ] Using the ankle-foot orthosis was effective during the initial training of lower limb muscle activities and the static balance training of chronic stroke patients .
However , it was not effective for a variety of dynamic situations .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Stroke patients are characterized by an asymmetric posture due to decreased movement , and this asymmetric posture makes balance control in a standing posture difficult , as a result of the center of pressure moving toward the lower limb of the unaffected side , triggering problems with postural control ability1 ) .
Loss of balance ability in stroke patients may cause increased postural sway , reduction of weight on the lower limb of the affected side , and increased fall risk2 ) .
In general , balance or postural stability refers to maintaining the center of mass within the support surface to maintain static action and to perform desired motions .
Balance ability is essential for functional activities , as well as for actions such as sitting , standing , and walking3 ) .
To maintain and adjust balance , the proprioceptive , visual , and vestibular senses must interact4 ) .
However , 65 % of stroke patients experience loss of tactile and proprioceptive senses , largely because of impaired in proprioception resulting from lowered muscle tone5 ) .
Various methods exist to resolve problems of balance of stroke patients .
These include therapeutic exercises , such as weight shifting to the lower limb of the affected side , proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques , Bobath techniques , neurodevelopmental facilitation techniques , and task-oriented exercises6 , 7 ) .
Repetitive exercise is necessary to improve balance , and ankle-foot orthoses are used for hours when there is excessive spasticity or deformity .
Ankle orthoses stabilize the ankle joint and compensate for insufficient ankle dorsiflexion and mediolateral instability of the subtalar joint , increasing balance ability .
They also facilitate medial shift of the center of mass and weight shift toward the foot of the affected side , reducing asymmetric body posture8 ) .
Dysfunction of the foot and the ankle joint of stroke patients are closely associated with functional and kinetic aspects of the lumbar region and lower limbs , inevitably triggering overall body imbalance9 ) .
The ankle joint and the hip joint play important roles in providing body stability during stroke patients ' balance training .
The first type of postural control strategy is the ankle joint strategy , which primarily improves standing balance through muscle contraction of the ankle joint10 ) .
While walking with an ankle-foot orthosis , the moment of the dorsiflexion angle during the stance phase and plantarflexion during the terminal stance may increase11 ) .
In a static standing position , the ankle joint is used frequently12 ) , and according to comparisons of muscular strength between those who have experienced falls and those who have not , the extensors of the hip joint and the plantar flexor of the ankle joint show significant differences13 ) , indicating that loss of balance ability is closely related to the weakening of ankle strength14 ) .
Therefore , the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of balance training with an ankle-foot orthosis on stroke patients ' lower limb muscle activities and static balance maintenance .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : The subjects of this study were 25 stroke patients , and they were randomly assigned to a group with ankle-foot orthosis shoes ( AFO , n=13 ) and a group with shoes ( n=12 ) ( Table 1Table 1 .

Prior to participation in this study , the purpose was explained to the subjects and their guardians , and they consented to participate voluntarily .
The research and development review board for human subjects of Hallym University approved this study .
All procedures conformed to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki .
Inclusion criteria were : a diagnosis of stroke within the previous 6–12 months ; no evidence of vestibular system disorders , neurological deficits in the bilateral lower limbs , or visual or auditory disorders ; a mini – mental state examination-Korean score of 23 or higher ; a Berg Balance Scale score of 40 or higher without any musculoskeletal deficit that affected standing balance ; and agreement to wear a plastic ankle-foot orthosis of the plantar flexion 90 ° ankle stop-type .
A Tele Myo 2400 T dynamic electromyograph ( EMG , Noraxon Inc. Arizona , USA ) was employed to measure muscle activities of the lower limbs .
The electrodes were attached to the affected side over the tibialis anterior muscle at one-third of the distance from the proximal tibialis anterior muscle , and the muscle belly of the medial gastrocnemius muscle 2 cm proximal from where the Achilles tendon encounters the medial gastrocnemius muscle .
The collected surface EMG signals were digitized using Myoresearch-XP 1.07 software : EMG signals were sampled at 1000 Hz , bandpass-filtered between 20 to 500 Hz , and processed with a 60 Hz notch filter .
A Tetrax Portable Multiple System ( Tetrax , Tetrax Ltd , Ramat Gan , Israel ) was used to measure balance ability15 ) .
When a subject places a foot on the force plate , the data of the pressure on the force plate is amplified and filtered before being delivered to a computer .
It is then analyzed using the Tetrax software program .
For the measurement of static balance ability , the stability index was obtained , and the collected data were recorded as percentages of the subjects ' body weights .
The ankle-foot orthosis used in this study was a joint type , and it was appended and raised by 1/8 of an inch so that the medial malleolus and the lateral malleolus did not meet , and the arch support maintained or supported the longitudinal arch when it was worn .
The medial and lateral sides of the caput metatarsals tend to widen when they support weight ; therefore , each of the medial sides and the lateral sides were widened by 1/16 inch and the orthosis was made to be a plantar flexion 90 ° ankle stop-type using a 5 mm thick thermoplastic material that melted at 170 ° C .
The shoes were made of rubber so as not to slide .
Bands wrapped around the top of the shoes so that they were not easy to remove , and they were made lightweight so that they could be used indoors .
Prior to and after the balance training , muscle activities and balance ability were measured .
Four balance exercises were conducted , two on flat ground and two on a balance pad ( balance pad , Airex , Switzerland ) for a total of 20 minutes ( Table 2Table 2 .

To measure the muscle activities in a standing position , the subject maintained a standing position in bare feet for five seconds .
Data were recorded for three seconds from the tibialis anterior muscle and the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the affected side ; the first and the last one seconds were excluded from the data analysis .
Muscle activity signals of each muscle were converted to root mean square values , and expressed as % maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( % MVIC ) .
For the measurement of balance ability , the subjects stood on a hard surface with their eyes open and with their eyes closed and on a soft pillow with their eyes open and with their eyes closed .
They maintained the standing position without holding a support .
Measurements were made three times in each position , and the average values were used the analysis .
The statistical analysis of this study was performed using PASW 18.0 .
We used the independent t-test to compare differences between the two groups , and the paired t-test to compare within-group differences , before and after the intervention .
Significance was accepted for values of p<0.05 .
BODY.RESULTS : Muscle activity prior to and after the balance training was compared between the AFO and shoes group .
Muscle activity of the tibialis anterior muscle of the affected side of the AFO group decreased from 19.93 ± 4.85 % prior to the balance training to 16.71 ± 3.88 % after the balance training and muscle activity of the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the affected side increased from 23.65 ± 8.10 % prior to the balance training to 26.64 ± 5.83 % after the balance training , and both differences were significant ( p<0.05 ) .
Muscle activity of the tibialis anterior muscle of the affected side of the shoes group decreased from 20.26 ± 3.83 % prior to the balance training to 20.23 ± 3.49 % after the balance training and muscle activity of the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the affected side increased from 24.87 ± 4.59 % prior to the balance training to 25.51 ± 5.11 % after the balance training ; neither of the differences was significantly different .
There was a significant difference in the muscle activities of the tibialis anterior muscle of the affected side between the AFO and shoes groups ( p<0.05 ) ( Table 3Table 3 .

BODY.DISCUSSION : This study examined the effects of ankle-foot orthosis during balance training of chronic stroke patients on muscle activities and static balance of the lower limbs of stroke patients .
After the six weeks of balance training , the data of the two groups were compared to examine muscle activities and static balance around the ankles related to wearing of the ankle-foot orthosis .
The stability index was significantly different in the NO condition between the groups , and the AFO group showed statistically significant differences in all conditions between prior to and after the balance training .
The changes in AFO group muscle activities were significantly greater than those of the shoes group .
After balance training with the ankle-foot orthosis , there was no significant difference in the medial gastrocnemius muscle activity of the affected side , but there was a significant difference in the tibialis anterior muscle activity of the affected side .
During balance training with the ankle-foot orthosis , the muscle activity of the tibialis anterior muscle of the affected side decreased and the muscle activity of the medial gastrocnemius muscle increased .
However , in the group without the ankle-foot orthosis , there was no pre-post statistically significant difference in either the muscle activity of the tibialis anterior muscle or the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the affected side .
This result is consistent with a study in which the ankle muscle activities of nine males and one female in a static standing posture were examined , and the use of the ankle plantar flexor was predominant18 ) .
It is also in agreement with a study in which the anterior-posterior center of pressure of six multiple sclerosis patients and four ordinary subjects were examined in a standing position and the use of the gastrocnemius was predominant19 ) .
However , an ankle-foot orthosis used postural adjustment by 42 stroke patients whose onset of a stroke was 6 months prior or earlier , and 61 stroke patients whose onset of a stroke was 12 months ago or longer , was effective at providing stability for the ankle of early phase stroke patients but not chronic phase stroke patients , as structural changes has occurred , including changes in alignment and muscle shortening20 ) .
There was a statistically significant difference in the stability index of NO between the AFO and shoes group , but there were no statistically significant differences in NC , PO , and PC between the two groups .
In the group who wore the ankle-foot orthosis , there were significant differences in the stability indexes of NO , NC , PO , and PC , and in the group who wore only shoes , there were significant differences in NO and PO .
This result is similar to that of study in which postural sway of 28 stroke and traumatic brain injury patients was measured with and without an ankle-foot orthosis ; when the ankle-foot orthosis was worn , postural sway was small2 ) .
Our results are also consistent with those of a study in which balance maintenance of 11 stroke patients and 10 ordinary subjects wearing an ankle-foot orthosis was examined : weight shift to the lateral side and an increase in weight bearing on the affected side resulted in more use of an ankle strategy than a hip strategy for stability4 ) .
In the rehabilitation process of stroke patients , improvement of balance ability is important .
In prescribing orthoses , improvement in balance ability and gait should be considered .
In general , use of an ankle-foot orthosis may be helpful for some stroke patients ' balance , but stroke patients differ in degree and area of anatomical damage .
Therefore , changes must be made in accordance with their environment and condition .
Balance training variables appropriate for patients should be selected , and effective treatment methods should be utilized to maximize patients ' potential capabilities .
Generalization of this study is limited , as only those patients meeting the selection criteria were examined .
Future research that includes the same kind of patients with classification of etiology and brain lesions is necessary .
