TITLE : Effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of Axitinib ( AG-013736 ) in Japanese and Caucasian healthy volunteers ABSTRACT.PURPOSE : Axitinib , a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 , 2 , 3 , is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 and glucuronidation .
This study evaluated the effect of rifampin , a potent inducer of drug-metabolizing enzymes , on axitinib plasma pharmacokinetics .
Equal numbers of Japanese and Caucasian subjects were enrolled to assess the potential differences in axitinib pharmacokinetics between the two ethnicities .
ABSTRACT.METHODS : Forty healthy volunteers were randomized to receive 5 mg axitinib alone and with 600 mg rifampin .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Rifampin expectedly decreased AUCinf and Cmax of axitinib ( geometric mean reduced by 79 and 71 % , respectively ) .
However , differences in axitinib pharmacokinetics were not observed between Japanese and Caucasian subjects ( geometric mean ratios for axitinib treatment alone for AUCinf and Cmax were 103 and 96 % ) .
ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : The results support a common axitinib starting dose in both populations .
Potent inducers of drug-metabolizing enzymes reduce axitinib exposure and dose adjustments may be needed for optimal efficacy .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Axitinib ( AG-013736 ) is an oral , potent , and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 , 2 , 3 [ 1 ] .
Early clinical trial experience in over 500 cancer patients has demonstrated that it has activity and is well-tolerated as a single agent [ 2–4 ] and in combination with various chemotherapeutic regimens [ 5 , 6 ] .
Axitinib is currently in phase III development for advanced renal cell carcinoma and in phase II development for various other tumor types .
Clinically , axitinib is administered 5 mg twice daily as an oral starting dose and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by rapid oral absorption ( with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1–2 h after dosing in the fasted state ) and a terminal plasma half-life of 3–5 h. Axitinib has an oral absolute bioavailability of approximately 58 % ( Pfizer Inc. , Data on file 2008 ) with generally linear pharmacokinetics [ 7 ] .
Axitinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 , CYP2C19 and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) 1A1 [ 6 ] .
Therefore , axitinib plasma exposure has the potential to be affected by the co-administration of drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A .
This has been previously observed with the co-administration of CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole , which increased the area under the plasma concentration – time curve from time 0 to 24 h ( AUC(0–24 ) ) and maximal plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of axitinib approximately 2- and 1.5-fold , respectively [ 8 ] .
Rifampin is a known potent CYP3A4 inducer along with other drug-metabolizing enzymes including CYP1A2 and UGT1A1 , and is hence likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of axitinib [ 9–11 ] .
In addition , subjects who are homozygous for UGT1A1 * 28 variant gene have the potential for reduced glucuronidation of axitinib .
Due to differences in the frequency of UGT1A1 * 28 genotype between Caucasians ( 12 % , range 9–16 % ) and Japanese ( 4 % , range 1–6 % ) [ 12–22 ] , this may also contribute to differences in the pharmacokinetics between these ethnicities .
The primary objective of this phase I study was to investigate potential pharmacokinetic interaction in healthy volunteers when axitinib is administered in combination with rifampin .
Secondary objectives included : ( 1 ) assessing potential inter-ethnic differences between Caucasian and Japanese subjects , ( 2 ) evaluating the effect of UGT1A1 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib , ( 3 ) evaluating the safety and tolerability of axitinib alone and when co-administered with rifampin .
BODY.METHODS.SUBJECTS : This study was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles originating in or derived from the Declaration of Helsinki ( Revised Edinburgh , 2000 ) and in accordance with all International Conference on Harmonization and Good Clinical Practice guidelines .
The final protocol and informed consent documentation were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the study center ( Radiant Covance , Hawaii , USA ) .
Key inclusion criteria included : female of non-childbearing potential or male , age 18–55 years ; Caucasian or first-generation Japanese ( both parents of Japanese descent , born in Japan and resident outside of Asia for ≤5 years ) ; and body mass index 18–28 kg/m2 with total body weight > 45 kg ( 99 lb ) .
Key exclusion criteria included : clinically significant medical or surgical conditions with the potential to interfere with the absorption , distribution , metabolism or excretion of the study drugs ; history of alcohol consumption > 14 drinks/week for men or 7 drinks/week for women within 6 months of screening ; smoker ; electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality ; blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg on two evaluations at least 10 min apart ; and treatment with an investigational drug or any known CYP450 enzyme-inducing/-inhibiting agents or herbal supplements within 30 days prior to first dose of study medication .
Subjects were to abstain from using prescription and non-prescription drugs ( other than acetaminophen as deemed necessary ) , vitamins and dietary supplements within 7 days prior to the first dose of study medication and throughout the study .
BODY.METHODS.TREATMENTS : This single-center , open-label study involved subjects being assigned to two separate treatment sequences according to a two-way crossover design .
The two treatments involved subjects receiving single 5 mg axitinib as an oral dose on day 1 ( treatment A ) , and subjects receiving rifampin ( Rifadin ® , Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Bridgewater , NJ , USA ) 600 mg/day orally for 9 days with a single 5 mg oral dose of axitinib co-administered on day 8 ( treatment B ) .
In both treatment arms , axitinib was administered in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 10 h. To standardize conditions , subjects were not allowed to eat or drink ( except water ) for at least 4 h following dosing .
To ensure full compliance , all doses of study medication were administered under medical supervision at the clinic .
Subjects received treatments A and B according to a crossover design .
Volunteers initially receiving treatment A adhered to a 7-day washout period before commencing treatment B ; those initially receiving treatment B adhered to a 21-day washout before treatment A began .
Washout was required to allow elimination of axitinib from plasma and for recovery from rifampin-mediated enzyme induction .
BODY.METHODS.STUDY ASSESSMENTS.SAMPLE COLLECTION : Blood samples ( 5 mL ) for determination of axitinib plasma concentration were collected pre-dose and at 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 and 32 h following axitinib administration on both treatment arms .
BODY.METHODS.STUDY ASSESSMENTS.BIOANALYTICAL METHODS : Plasma concentrations of axitinib were measured using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection method ( Charles River Discovery and Development Services ; Worcester , MA , USA ) [ 7 ] .
The limit of quantification for the axitinib assay in plasma was 0.1 ng/mL , the between-day precision was < 15.7 % and bias < 12.8 % for quality control samples evaluated in the concentration range of interest .
Pharmacodynamic evaluations consisted of the ratio of urinary 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol concentrations as a marker of CYP3A4 induction [ 23 ] .
The limit of quantification for the cortisol assay in urine was 2.5 ng/mL , the between-day precison was < 12.5 % and the bias was < 15 % .
For 6 , β-hydroxycortisol in urine , the limit of quantification was 12.5 ng/mL , the between-day precision was < 8.7 % and bias was < 16 % .
The urinary 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio was calculated for all subjects .
During treatment A , urine samples were collected pre-dose ( baseline ) .
During treatment B , urine samples were collected pre-dose ( baseline ) and in the morning on days 8 and 9 following combination treatment with axitinib and rifampin .
Urine concentrations of cortisol and 6 , β-hydroxycortisol were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric detection ( ABC Laboratories ; Columbia , MO , USA ) .
BODY.METHODS.STUDY ASSESSMENTS.GENOTYPING : To assess possible differences in metabolism , subjects were genotyped for metabolizing enzymes including UGT1A1 .
DNA was extracted from whole blood using Qiagen 's QIAamp kit .
The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify DNA samples .
The Sequenom MassArray was used to perform the genotyping of the UGT1A1 * 28 ( Sequenom Discovery ) genotyping assay .
The genotypes were determined with MassARRAY RTTM software ( SpectroTYPERTM Version 3.4 , Sequenom ) .
The UGT1A1 * 28 genotype was investigated as an exploratory variable to determine the potential correlation with pharmacokinetic variability .
Specifically , the variants of UGT1A1 to be assessed included UGT1A1 * 60 , UGT1A1 - 3156 ( −3156 G→A nucleotide change ) , UGT1A1 promoter TA repeat ( * 28 , * 36 , * 37 ) , UGT1A1 * 6 and UGT1A1 * 27 .
BODY.METHODS.STUDY ASSESSMENTS.SAFETY : Adverse event ( AE ) monitoring , vital signs ( heart rate and blood pressure ) , 12-lead ECG recordings , and clinical laboratory tests were carried out .
AE severity was based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria ; relationship to treatment was determined by the investigator .
BODY.METHODS.PHARMACOKINETIC AND STATISTICAL EVALUATIONS : The pharmacokinetic evaluation of axitinib was performed with WinNonlin ( Version 4.01 , Pharsight , Mountain View , CA ) using a non-compartmental approach .
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for orally administered axitinib included AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity ( AUCinf ) and from time zero to the time for the last quantifiable concentration ( AUClast ) , Cmax , time to Cmax ( Tmax ) , terminal half-life , oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized by treatment , ethnicity and genotype .
For the parameters AUCinf , AUClast and Cmax , a statistical analysis to determine the estimated ratio of adjusted geometric means and the associated 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) was performed .
A sample size of 32 subjects was determined to have sufficient power to detect treatment differences in AUCinf and Cmax .
An additional eight subjects were enrolled to account for possible dropouts .
BODY.RESULTS.SUBJECTS : A total of 40 male subjects ( Caucasian , n = 20 ; Japanese , n = 20 ) with a mean ( ±standard deviation ) age of 29 ( ±7.6 ) years ( range 21–52 years ) and a mean weight of 72.3 ( ±9.5 ) kg ( range 54.0–96.7 kg ) were enrolled .
During the enrollment period of 6 months for this study , no women of non-childbearing potential who otherwise met study entry criteria were found ; hence , only male subjects eventually were enrolled in this study .
One subject failed to complete both treatment periods for reasons unrelated to treatment ( failed drug test ) but was included in the evaluable population .
Hence , all subjects ( n = 40 ) received at least one axitinib 5 mg oral dose and 39 subjects received axitinib and rifampin combination therapy .
BODY.RESULTS.CYP3A4 INDUCTION : The mean urinary 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio was 4.2 ± 3.5 at baseline and increased to 18.6 ± 15.8 after 8 days of rifampin dosing .
After cessation of rifampin treatment , the mean 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio returned to near baseline values ( 4.6 ± 3.4 ) .
Similar results were observed in Caucasian and Japanese subjects .
In Caucasian subjects , mean 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio was 4.5 ± 2.6 at baseline and increased to 15.3 ± 9.1 after 8 days of rifampin dosing and in Japanese subjects the mean ratio was 4.0 ± 4.3 at baseline and 21.7 ± 20.0 after 8 days of rifampin dosing .
BODY.RESULTS.PHARMACOKINETICS : The plasma concentration – time profiles of axitinib in the absence and presence of rifampin are shown in Fig. 1a .
Axitinib plasma concentrations were reduced when co-administered with rifampin .
Axitinib pharmacokinetic parameters for the entire evaluable subject population are reported in Table 1 and Fig. 1b , c. Geometric means of AUCinf and AUClast for axitinib were decreased by 79 [ geometric mean ratio 21 % ( 90 % CI 18–24 ) ] and 80 % [ geometric mean ratio 20 % ( 90 % CI 17–23 ) ] respectively , when co-administered with rifampin .
The geometric mean for axitinib Cmax was reduced by 71 % when co-administered with rifampin [ geometric mean ratio 29 % ( 90 % CI 24–35 ) ] .
The axitinib plasma half-life appeared to be decreased in the presence of rifampin ( Table 1 ) ; however this should be interpreted with caution since this is likely due to axitinib plasma concentrations falling below the limit of quantification at later time-points in the presence of rifampin which resulted in poorly estimated terminal half-life in many subjects .

The geometric mean ratio ( Japanese versus Caucasian ) for axitinib AUCinf and Cmax was 103 ( 90 % CI 71–151 ) and 96 % ( 90 % CI 64–144 ) respectively .
When axitinib was administered alone , median peak plasma concentrations of axitinib were achieved in 1.5 h ( range 1.5–2 h ) after dosing in Caucasian volunteers and 1.75 h ( range 0.5–2 h ) in Japanese subjects as shown in Fig. 2a .
In subjects administered axitinib and rifampin in combination , axitinib mean peak plasma concentrations were observed at 1.5 h after dosing in both ethnic groups ( Fig. 2b ) .
Figure 3a , b compares the AUCinf and Cmax , respectively , of axitinib in Caucasian and Japanese volunteers in the presence and absence of rifampin and demonstrate no differences .
Inter-subject variability for axitinib AUCinf measured by coefficient of variation was similar in Japanese and Caucasian subjects at 65 and 54 % , respectively .

Of the 40 subjects eventually recruited over the enrollment period , three Caucasian and one Japanese subject were homozygous variant for UGT1A1 * 28 .
In both Caucasian and Japanese subjects , pharmacokinetic parameters ( AUCinf and Cmax ) were similar for subjects with all UGT1A1 * 28 genotypes as shown in Fig. 4a and b respectively .

Data provided in this figure are following administration of axitinib alone ( i.e. , in the absence of rifampin ) .

Circles represent values for each subject BODY.RESULTS.SAFETY : None of the AEs were treatment-related or resulted in treatment discontinuation , dose reduction , or death during the study .
No clinically relevant mean changes in hematology , vital sign or ECG findings were noted in the overall safety population or in either ethnic groups .
BODY.DISCUSSION : The results of this study demonstrate three important findings .
First , as expected , axitinib exposure is decreased when concomitantly administered with rifampin in healthy volunteers .
Second , there is no difference in the plasma pharmacokinetics of axitinib in healthy Caucasian and Japanese subjects .
Third , UGT1A1 * 28 polymorphism does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of axitinib .
The ratio of urinary 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol has been used previously as a measure of CYP3A4 induction [ 23 ] .
In this study , the ratio of urinary 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol concentrations in subjects was consistent with maximal induction of CYP3A4 and returned to normal following washout after the end of rifampin dosing .
The maximally observed effect was similar between Japanese and Caucasian subjects after 8 days of rifampin dosing .
In addition , there was no difference in the 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratios between Caucasian and Japanese subjects .
These results are consistent with effective CYP3A induction with rifampin in both Caucasian and Japanese subjects .
Results from this study indicate that geometric mean AUCinf and Cmax for axitinib were decreased by 79 and 71 % , respectively , when co-administered with rifampin .
Induction of CYP3A4 with rifampin 600 mg/day has been demonstrated in previous studies using the ratio of 6 , β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol in urine [ 23 ] .
In addition , rifampin has also been shown to induce UGT1A1 and other drug-metabolizing enzymes in clinical studies [ 11 , 24 ] .
Induction of axitinib metabolism as mediated by CYP3A4 in healthy , non-smoking volunteers resulted in a substantial decrease in axitinib plasma concentration .
This study therefore provides the lower bound for ( minimum ) plasma concentrations expected following an oral dose of 5 mg axitinib , i.e. , in the presence of a potent metabolic inducer .
First-generation Japanese subjects recruited in this study were required to have been born in Japan , not lived outside of Asia for more than 5 years , and should have had both parents of Japanese descent .
Ethnic differences in axitinib pharmacokinetics between Japanese and Caucasian subjects were minimal ; the geometric mean ratios for axitinib AUCinf and Cmax were not statistically different between Caucasian and Japanese subjects and pharmacokinetic parameters were similar between the subjects , indicating that these ethnicities do not contribute significantly to the axitinib pharmacokinetic variability observed in this study .
In addition , safety data were similar for Caucasian and Japanese subjects .
Previous in vitro studies with human liver microsomes have indicated the involvement of UGT1A1 in the glucuronidation of axitinib , and so the effect of the UGT1A1 * 28 genotype on axitinib pharmacokinetics was also explored in Caucasian and Japanese subjects .
Subjects who are variant for UGT1A1 * 28 have the potential for reducing glucuronidation of axitinib .
The frequency of variant UGT1A1 * 28 is 12 % ( range 9–16 % ) for Caucasians and 4 % ( range 1–6 % ) for Japanese populations [ 12–22 ] .
Although this study was not statistically powered to detect genotype-mediated changes , axitinib pharmacokinetic parameters were similar across UGT1A1 * 28 genotypes and ethnicity , implying that this genotype does not likely contribute to the axitinib pharmacokinetic variability observed in this study .
Single-dose axitinib , alone or in combination with rifampin , was well tolerated by healthy volunteers in this study .
Combination treatment with rifampin for 8 days did not produce any drug-related AEs .
All observed AEs were deemed not related to study drug by the investigator .
No serious or clinically significant AEs were reported .
BODY.CONCLUSIONS : A reduction in axitinib exposure is observed when co-administered with repeated doses of rifampin .
Concomitant treatment with axitinib and potent inducers of CYP3A4 would require axitinib dose adjustment for optimal clinical efficacy .
The similarity of axitinib pharmacokinetics in Caucasian and Japanese subjects supports a common starting dose and regimen in these populations .
