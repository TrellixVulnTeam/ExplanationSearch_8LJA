TITLE : Cognitive basis about risk level classifications for the self-assessment of older drivers ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] This study analyzed the cognitive functions according to risk level for the Driver 65 Plus measure , and examined the cognitive basis of self-assessment for screening the driving risk of elderly drivers .
[ Subjects and Methods ] A total of 46 older drivers with a driver 's license participated in this study .
All participants were evaluated with Driver 65 Plus .
They were classified into three groups of " safe , " " caution " and " stop , " and examined for cognitive functions with Trail Making Test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-K.
The cognitive test results of the three groups were compared .
[ Results ] Trail Making Test-A , Trail Making Test-B , and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-K showed a significant difference between the three groups .
The safe group showed significantly higher ability than the caution and stop groups in the three cognitive tests .
In addition , cognitive functions of naming , attention , language , and delayed recall were significantly different between the three groups .
[ Conclusion ] Self-assessment of older drivers is a useful tool for screening the cognitive aspects of driving risk .
The cognitive functions , such as attention and recall , are the critical factors for screening the driving risk of elderly drivers .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Driving ability of older drivers is reduced due to the overall dysfunction involved in the natural aging process1 ) .
Almost half of all drivers are older , and their accident rate has continued to increase2 , 3 ) .
Therefore , recently , elderly driving experts have committed to the screening of at-risk older drivers to prevent accidents4 ) .
The accident risk of drivers has been reported to be highly relevant to motor ability , cognitive function , self-regulation ability , and medical condition5 , 6 ) .
In particular , cognitive functions have been reported as a key screening element in the elderly driver due to characteristics of the aging process7 ) .
Therefore , cognitive assessment is used as a driving screening tool for older drivers4 ) .
The commonly used cognitive tests include the Trail Making Test ( TMT ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MOCA ) , Useful Field of View ( UFOV ) , Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , and Clock Drawing Test (CDT)8,9,10 ) .
Older drivers have a self-regulation that can prevent accidents by enhancing the sensitivity to the changes due to aging11 ) .
This ability can be measured through behavior that occurs during the operation of the self-assessment , and it can be used to monitor the broader population12 ) .
The major self-assessments include Driver 65 Plus , the Safe Driving Behavior Measure , SAFER Driving , and the Driving Decisions Workbook , among others13 ) .
In particular , Driver 65 Plus consists of 15 questions , and it is relatively simple to use ; as such , the facilitation of the monitoring of low concentration elderly drivers is an advantage14 ) .
Despite this advantage , the reliability of the evaluation report by the elderly themselves is no less a problem14 ) .
Therefore , further evidence that the accuracy of older drivers ' self-assessment in driving-related function is needed to use it for rehabilitation of elderly drivers15,16,17 ) .
The research that confirms the ability to the discrimination of the driving-related functions with self-assessment will provide the basis for the screening of driving risk in rehabilitation of older drivers .
In particular , verification of cognitive function , a key element in elderly driving , will be an important basis for elderly driving rehabilitation .
Driver 65 Plus separates the elderly drivers into " Safe " , " Caution " , " Stop " groups , depending on their score .
Therefore , the analysis on the differences in cognitive function according to the classification may identify whether there are cognitive effects of screening the risk of self-assessment .
The purpose of this study was to confirm the basis for screening the driving risk of self-assessment through analysis of cognitive functions , in accordance with the classification of Driver 65 Plus .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Forty-seven older drivers with a driver 's license were recruited from August to September 2016 .
The study participants were enrolled from a senior citizens ' center of Korea .
All study protocols were presented to all subjects and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki , 1995 .
Participants with no senile and neurological disease were included .
One participant with an incomplete assessment was excluded .
Forty-six older drivers participated in this study .

There was no significant difference among the three groups .
This study was carried out by dividing the process into four steps .
In the first step , Driver 65 Plus was used to evaluate the driving risk of the participants .
In the second step , the subjects were classified into three groups according to their score of Driver 65 Plus .
In the next step , the safe group ( n=12 ) , the caution group ( n=26 ) and the stop group ( n=8 ) underwent a cognitive function assessment .
In the final step , the cognitive test results of the three groups were compared .
Driver
65 Plus is a self-assessment for screening the risk of the driver , and it was developed by the AAA ( Australian Automobile Association ) Foundation for Traffic Safety .
It consists of 15 questions that ask about the behaviors or conditions associated with driving .
The combined scores of each question are defined as " 0–15 , safe driving , " " 16–34 , caution driving , " and " ≥35 , stop driving"18 ) .
MOCA-K measures visuospatial executive function , naming , attention , language , abstraction , delayed recall .
It was reported to be associated with driving9 ) .
The TMT is divided into the A or B type .
TMT-A measures the response time , attention , sequencing , and visual scanning ; and additionally , TMT-B measures the shift-attention , executive function , and decision-making .
They are used to predict driving risk due to the high association with elderly drivers19 ) .
SPSS 18.0 was used for statistical analysis .
An one-way ANOVA was used to assess the differences in the cognitive functions between the three groups .
A p value<0.05 was considered statistically significant .

The safe group showed higher ability in the three cognitive tests than in the caution and stop groups .
Additionally , the caution group showed higher ability in the TMT-B and MOCA-K than the stop group .
The four items showed a significant difference between the three groups .
The safe group showed higher ability in the items of naming , attention , and language than the stop group .
On the other hand , the safe group showed higher ability in the item of delayed recall than the caution and stop groups .
BODY.DISCUSSION : This study classified elderly drivers into " safe , " " caution , " and " stop " groups through Driver 65 Plus .
TMT and MOCA-K were significantly different between the three groups .
Thus , it confirmed the cognitive basis for the prediction of the risk of elderly drivers with Driver 65 Plus .
Through Scheffe posteriori test results , TMT-B significant differences were found in all comparisons between the three groups .
In contrast , TMT-A was significant different only between safe and stop groups .
It is interpreted that this was due to TMT-B having more measures on decision-making , executive function and shift attention , compared to the TMT-A20 ) .
Driving is a highly complex task that requires attention , memory , response time , decision-making , and executive function , among other factors21 ) .
Therefore , this can be seen in the results of TMT-B , which measured high-level cognitive function more sensitively .
This result is consistent with the pre-study that indicated that TMT-B was more effective in predicting the risk of senior drivers19 ) .
MOCA-K ( used to measure the overall cognitive functions9 ) ) was significantly different in all of comparisons between three groups .
In addition , it was confirmed that a significant difference between the sub-areas of naming , attention , language , delayed recall was present .
Older drivers are required to have cognitive functions such as shift-attention , selective-attention , processing speed , long-term memory , and decision-making22 ) .
Because of this characteristic , it is assumed that there is a difference in the attention and delayed recall of the study .
The difference of the language was determined to be caused by the evaluation method of Driver 65 Plus .
Elderly drivers with a high vocabulary can respond better to these evaluations that require reading and understanding .
In the other measure , the cognitive functions of orientation and abstraction were also related with older drivers .
But , a significant difference between the groups was not reported .
Nevertheless , the mean of the safe group was higher than the caution and stop groups .
In general , the mean difference analysis is sensitive to the increase of the number of subjects in the sample23 ) .
Because of the limited sample , it is estimated that the cognitive functions did not show a statistically significant difference in this study .
Therefore , future research studies that include a sufficient sample size will be needed to provide strong evidence .
This study confirmed the cognitive basis of self-assessment for elderly drivers .
This finding can be used as the evidence for screening dangerous older drivers through self-assessment in elderly drivers ' rehabilitation .
Besides this , a multifaceted study related to older drivers will be required .
