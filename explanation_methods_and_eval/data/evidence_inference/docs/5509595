TITLE : Effects of endurance exercise and half-bath on body composition , cardiorespiratory system , and arterial pulse wave velocity in men with intellectual disabilities ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ]
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of endurance exercise and half-bath on body composition , cardiorespiratory system , and arterial pulse wave velocity of men with intellectual disabilities .
[ Subjects and Methods ] Twenty-four men with intellectual disabilities , but capable of learning , were randomly assigned to aerobic exercise ( N=8 ) , half-bath ( N=8 ) , or control ( N=8 ) treatment groups .
Over the 12-week treatment period , the aerobic exercise group did treadmill and stationary bicycle .
The half-bath treatment group was placed in a sitting position in a 39–40 ° C bath for 10 minutes .
[ Results ] The aerobic exercise group showed a significant decrease in body fat than those in the half-bath and control groups .
In addition , there was an increase in the respiratory system of the aerobic exercise group but no increase in the half-bath and control groups .
The arterial pulse wave velocity change was greatest in the aerobic exercise group , but the half-bath group also showed a velocity change from that in the control group .
[ Conclusion ]
Aerobic exercise and a half-bath can have positive effects on improving body composition , respiratory system , and vascular function of people with intellectual disabilities .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Korean government operates special schools and vocational training centers for the disabled in Korean cities and provinces .
Such programs are designed to support the attainment of a healthy life through participation in regular physical activities .
However , due to insufficient budget and manpower , the government program can not reach its full potential , thus there is room for improvement .
Especially , the cognitive ability of men with intellectual disabilities is significantly lower than that of the general population , and many disabled find it difficult to perform voluntary and/or regular physical activities1 ) .
Draheim2 ) emphasized the need for dietary control and physical activity in adults with intellectual disabilities as most of whom are at risk for cardiovascular disease .
As such , many people with intellectual disabilities are weak or obese due to their physical disabilities3 ) .
This increases their potential for developing various geriatric diseases3 ) .
Therefore , there is a need to emphasize the necessity of regular physical activity among the disabled .
In order to develop a basic exercise program that can lead to a healthy life for the intellectually disabled , this study investigated the effects of endurance exercise and half-bath treatments on body composition , the cardiorespiratory system , and arterial pulse wave velocity in men with intellectual disabilities .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Subjects included 12 men from the Korea Employment Promotion Agency and 12 from the H Welfare Foundation .
Other than intellectual disability , the 24 subjects had no medically overlapping disabilities and had no experience in performing regular exercise .
The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups : aerobic exercise group ( N=8 ; age=19.3 ± 1.2 yrs ; height=163.2 ± 2.6 cm ; weight=65.6 ± 1.5 kg ; body fat=32.3 ± 1.6 % ) , the half-bath group ( N=8 ; age=18.9 ± 2.5 yrs ; height=165.8 ± 1.9 cm ; weight=66.8 ± 1.9 kg ; body fat=33.0 ± 1.5 % ) , and the control group ( N=8 ; age=20.2 ± 1.1 yrs ; height=162.8 ± 2.1 cm ; weight=65.5 ± 1.4 kg ; body fat=32.4 ± 1.1 % ) .
Subjects were not allowed to eat for 4 hours before treatment and exercise for 12 hours before treatment4 ) .
Bioelectrical impedance instrument ( InBodyJ20 , Bio-Space , Seoul , Korea ) was used for measuring the body composition .
Before the exercise tolerance was estimated by using the Balke-Ware protocol .
The speed of the treadmill was fixed at 3.3 miles per hour ( mph ) with an initial slope of 2 % , which was increased by 1 % every minute .
Heart rate , respiratory , and circulatory variables were recorded by using an electrocardiograph instrument ( ECG ; CH-2000 , Cambridge , Switzerland ) and a gas analyzer ( quark b2 , Italy ) .
In addition , the vessel compliance was measured in a lying state by using a vessel compliance equipment ( PWV 3.0-K_M TEC , Korea ) .
The aerobic exercise program was performed between 50–70 % HRmax .
During the study treatment period , two 15-minute exercise periods were performed within a 50-minute period 5 times a week for 12 weeks .
To ensure accurate exercise intensity during exercise , a Polar heart rate monitor ( Polxar Electro , Technogym , Finland ) and the receiver ( S710i , Polar , Finland ) was used .
Participants in the half-bath group were bathed five times a week for twelve weeks in the H sauna located in D city , district Y. Half-bath group participants were placed in a sitting position in a 39–40 ° C bath for 10 minutes .
Bath water level was kept below the navel and during the post-bath 5-minute rest period , the subject 's body temperature was reduced for 1 minute in tepid and cold water by using a shower .
Drinks were provided to prevent dehydration .
This process was repeated 3 times per day for a total bathing time of 30 minutes per day .
Meanwhile , the control subjects did not participate in any exercise program or half-bath treatment .
All data obtained in this study were analyzed by using SPSS 20.0 version ( IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) .
Descriptive statistics were used to assess means and standard deviations of subjects ' physical characteristics .
To assess differences in the measured variables among the groups , and by measurement period , results were analyzed by performing repeated two-way ANOVA .
The significance level was set at p<0.05 .
All subjects ' parents were informed of the content and purpose of the experiment and all provided written informed consent before beginning the study .
The experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Mokwon University .

According to those results , body composition , maximal oxygen uptake , heart rate , and arterial pulse wave velocity were significantly different among the groups .
There were also differences related to time of measurement and interaction .
BODY.DISCUSSION : The results of this study showed a significant improvement of body composition in the exercise and half-bath treatment groups .
These results are consistent with those in previous studies .
Lee5 ) reported that when students with learning disability engage in extracurricular physical activities , their abdominal fat decreased markedly .
Shin6 ) reported that students with learning disorders who participated in basketball programs showed positive changes in their physical health and fitness .
Interestingly , the change in body composition in this study 's half-bath group would be the result of increasing the body temperature rather than from exercise7 , 8) .
It is assumed that the half-bath facilitated increased blood supply to peripheral blood vessels and promoted metabolism , thereby reducing body weight and body fat7 , 8) .
This present study was conducted with the intellectual disability without any disorders .
However , the disabled usually have a lower flexibility and strength .
The half-bath may cause the lymphatic fluid and venous blood to shrink in the hands and feet .
It is necessary to monitor the subject 's face color , eyes , and conversation at the time of exercise program and half-bath treatment .
In this study , the maximum oxygen uptake , HRmax , and maximum ventilation were also significantly increased after 12 weeks of treatment only in exercise group .
Park1 ) reported that participation in aerobic exercise programs resulted in statistically significant increases in oxygen uptake , ventilation , and heart rate maxima among the blind and visually impaired patients .
Evans and Rosenberg9 ) reported that maximum oxygen uptake increased by 15 % after 16 weeks of physical training of intellectually disabled subjects .
This study also found that the arterial wave velocity and the arterial pulse wave velocity were significantly reduced in both the exercise and half-bath groups from that in the control group , indicating that the blood vessel compliance was improved in the exercise and half-bath treatment groups .
The results of previous studies10 , 11 ) are consistent with this study .
Klemsdal et al.10 ) reported an increase in blood vessel compliance after exercise in subjects with atherosclerosis .
Koichiro et al.11 ) reported on the results of a 16-week aerobic exercise program for middle-aged men .
After the end of the program , there was a significant increase in the vascular elasticity of the carotid artery and a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure .
In summary , this study and previous studies indicate that regular physical activity improves vascular function , which can prevent cardiovascular disease and increase cardiovascular health .
However , it is difficult for people with intellectual disabilities to participate in exercise programs as they often need assistance due to their associated physical disabilities .
Therefore , more support is needed to improve the well-being of the disabled .
