TITLE : Effect of self-management training on adherence to medications among community residents with chronic schizophrenia : a singleblind randomized controlled trial in Shanghai , China ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Many community dwelling individuals with schizophrenia do not take medications regularly and , thus , are prone to frequent relapses .
ABSTRACT.AIM : Evaluate the effectiveness of self-management training on adherence to medications and relapse among individuals with chronic schizophrenia living in the community .
ABSTRACT.METHODS : A total of 201 individuals with chronic schizophrenia living in the urban and rural communities of Shanghai Municipality were randomized into a treatment as usual control group ( n=98 ) or a selfmanagement intervention group ( n=103 ) that received weekly self-management skills training for 6 months followed by 24 months of monthly group booster sessions in which a community health worker reviewed patients ' self-management checklists .
Two psychiatrists blind to the treatment status of patients , assessed adherence to medications using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and patients ' insight into their illness using the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorders ( SAUMD ) at baseline and 30 months after baseline .
A total of 194 individuals ( 95.6 % ) completed the study .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : There were no differences between groups at baseline , but after 30 months the intervention group had significantly better medication compliance , significantly greater insight into their illness , and ( by self-report ) were using significantly higher dosages of antipsychotic medication .
Only 2 ( 1.9 % ) of the 103 intervention group participants relapsed ( i.e. , experienced one or more re-hospitalizations ) over the 30 months of follow-up , but 14 ( 14.3 % ) of the 98 control group subjects relapsed ( X2=8.83 , p=0.003 ) .
ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : Given the large sample size , relatively long follow-up , randomized design , and single-blind evaluation of outcomes the dramatic reduction in relapse and improvements in medication adherence and insight identified in this study are robust findings .
These results extended our previous findings , which demonstrated the benefit of self-management training on improving the symptoms and social functioning of individuals with chronic schizophrenia living in the community .
Cost-benefit studies are now needed to assess the feasibility of up-scaling this self-management intervention to a wide range of communities .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : 1 .
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder with a high relapse rate and high levels of disability .
There are an estimated 16 million individuals with schizophrenia in China.[1 ] A previous study found that the symptoms of schizophrenia re-occurred in approximately 50 % of individuals within one year after remission of the previous episode and 85 % of individuals relapse within five years of the previous episode.[2 ] The prevention of relapse depends heavily on the proper use of antipsychotic medications , but the level of medication adherence among communitydwelling residents with mental disorders is only about 30%.[3 ] One reason for poor medication adherence in China is the underdeveloped state of the community mental health services , so many individuals with schizophrenia lack medical supervision.[4 ] Promotion of self-management strategies that stress the proactive participation of the affected individual themselves is one potential way to deal with this problem that , if effective , could cover a large proportion of community dwelling individuals with chronic mental illnesses.[5 ] Mental disorders share many features with chronic physical illnesses in terms of the course of disease and the rehabilitation process .
Individuals with mental disorders that have remitted are usually able to carry out self-management activities.[6 ] A study in 2006 by Yuan and colleagues found better medication adherence after selfmanagement training among a group of inpatients with schizophrenia.[7 ] A follow-up study by Li and colleagues in 2009 found similar results one year after discharge.[8 ] The current report is a secondary analysis of a previously reported randomized controlled trial[9 ] of self-management training for community dwelling individuals with chronic schizophrenia .
The initial report demonstrated that self-management training can improve symptoms and social functioning over a 30-month follow-up period .
The current paper reports on the effect of self-management training on medication adherence and relapse .
BODY.METHODS : 2 .
BODY.METHODS.SAMPLE : 2.1 As shown in Figure 1 , participants in this study were from 10 randomly selected communities , in the Sanlin Township of Pudong District in Shanghai .
All 314 individuals in this township enrolled in the ' Shanghai Mental Health Prevention and Rehabilitation System ' as of July 2011 were sent a letter with information about the aims and methods of the study inviting them to participate .
Enrolled participants met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria : ( a ) met the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia according to the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders , 3rd edition (CCMD-3),[10 ] ( b ) 18 to 60 years of age , ( c ) had a middle school education or higher , ( d ) had relatively stable symptoms ( Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS][11 ] score < 30 ) , ( e ) had no severe physical diseases , and ( f ) provided written informed consent ( signed by the participant and the guardian ) .
After excluding the 113 individuals who refused or did not meet the inclusion criteria , the remaining 201 individuals were randomly assigned ( by the toss of a coin ) to the intervention group ( n=103 ) or the control group ( n=98 ) .
Among these participants , 99 ( 96.1 % ) in the intervention group and 95 ( 96.9 % ) in the control group completed the 30-month follow-up assessment .
The 4 dropouts in the intervention group dropped out at the 2nd , 8th , 16th and 18th months of follow-up ; the 3 dropouts in the control group dropped out at the 7th , 24th , and 28th months .
Figure 1.Flowchart of the study The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pudong Yingbo Community Health Service Center .
BODY.METHODS.SELF-MANAGEMENT TRAINING GROUP : 2.2 A previous report provided a detailed description of the training process.[9 ] In brief , the training manual included the Medication Management and Symptom Management modules of the ' UCLA Social & Independent Living Skills program'[12 ] and information from other available sources .
These modules focus on helping participants understand the importance of adhering to medications and of recognizing residual symptoms and early signs of relapse .
Weekly 2-hour training sessions were provided to groups of 20 to 25 participants from the intervention group for six months .
Skills were taught using a combination of didactic instruction , group interactions , role-played rehearsals , and group discussions .
The 99 participants in the intervention group who completed the 30-month follow-up attended an average ( sd ) of 21.8 ( 2.0 ) of the 24 weekly sessions .
Upon completion of the six-months of training , participants received a ' self-management checklist journal ' to record their daily adherence to medications , quality of sleep , occurrence of side effects , occurrence of residual symptoms and early signs of relapse , daily activities , and general mood .
In most cases completion of this journal was monitored by a co-resident family member .
Participants also attended monthly selfmanagement group meetings ( ' booster sessions ' ) .
The 99 participants who completed the 30-month follow-up attended an average ( sd ) of 22.4 ( 1.5 ) of the 24 monthly sessions .
BODY.METHODS.TREATMENT-AS-USUAL CONTROL GROUP : 2.3 Individuals assigned to the control condition received regular outpatient treatment with medication and routine monitoring of medication adherence and clinical status by community mental health workers .
BODY.METHODS.ASSESSMENTS : 2.4 Medication adherence refers to the degree to which an individual correctly follows medical advice .
The revised version of the 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MAQ)[13 ] was used to assess the adherence to medications .
The four items are ( 1 )
" Do you ever forget to take your medicine ?
" ( 2 ) Are you careless at times about taking your medicine ?
" ( 3 ) When you feel better do you sometimes stop taking your medicine ?
"
( 4 )
" Sometimes if you feel worse when you take your medicine , do you stop taking it ?
" Items of the original western scale were binary ( yes or no ) ; we revised the items to be rated on a 0 - 4 Likert scale representing five levels varying from ' never ' to ' always ' .
The theoretical range in score of the four items is 0 to 16 , with higher scores representing poorer adherence .
This revised Chinese scale has previously been used to assess compliance in chronic physical illness[14 ] and in mental illness.[15 ] The internal consistency of the four items is good ( Cronbach Î±=0.76).[14 ] The 20-item Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorders (SAUMD)[16 ] was used to assess the insight of the participant .
There are four subscales of the SAUMD assessing the awareness of current symptoms , awareness of past symptoms , attribution of current symptoms , and attribution of past symptoms .
Every item is rated on a 1 - 5 Likert scale with higher scores indicating poorer insight .
A previous study in China[17 ] reported that the scale has good test-retest reliability : intraclass correlation coefficient ICC for the total score was 0.81 and that for the four subscale scores ranged from 0.70 to 0.89 .
Average dosage of antipsychotics was based on the participants ' self-report information and presented as chlorpromazine-equivalent dosage in milligrams per day .
Relapse is defined as one or more hospital admissions for treatment of schizophrenia during the 30-month follow-up period .
The MAQ , SAUMD and average daily dosage of medication were assessed at baseline and the end of the study ( 2.5 years after enrollment ) by two trained psychiatrists who were blind to the treatment status of participants .
The agreement between the two psychiatrists was good : the ICC for the independent evaluation of 30 patients by thetwo coders was 0.79 for the total SAUMD score and 0.73 of the total MAQ score .
To maintain the blinding throughout the study treating clinicians were not present during the evaluations , the two evaluators did not participate in any of the training sessions , and the two evaluators were specifically instructed not to ask participants about their participation in the study .
To limit measurement errors , whenever an evaluation resulted in a score for the MAQ or SAUMD that was more than 3 standard deviations above or below the group mean , a re-assessment by the second evaluator was conducted ; if the difference between the two assessments was small , the first score was retained , if the difference was large , expert opinion was sought to arrive at a final score .
Scores by the first evaluator were outside these 3 standard deviation limits only 5 times during the study ( 0.63 % of all evaluations ) .
In three of these cases the original score was retained and in two cases a revised score was used .
BODY.METHODS.ANALYSIS : 2.4 Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted using the last observation value carried forward method .
Means and standard deviations were used to describe continuous variables ; repeated measures analysis of variance with adjustment for post-hoc comparisons using the least significant difference ( LSD ) method to estimate the overall and between-group effects .
Paired t-tests were used for within-group comparisons .
Categorical variables were compared using Ï2 tests .
The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05 .
All tests were two-tailed .
BODY.RESULTS : 3 .
BODY.RESULTS.COMPARISONS AT BASELINE : 3.1 As shown in Table 1 , there were no differences in demographic characteristics between participants in the intervention and control groups .
There were also no differences between groups in terms of age of onset , duration of illness and number of hospitalizations .
Most of the participants were chronically ill , with a mean duration of illness of 17.4 years , and had had multiple hospitalizations .

The reported dosage had increased significantly from baseline in the intervention group but not in the control group .
Over the 30-month follow-up period 2 of the 103 individuals ( 1.9 % ) in the intervention group relapsed ( 1 was re-hospitalized once and one was re-hospitalized twice ) and 14 of the 98 individuals ( 14.3 % ) in the control group relapsed ( each of them was re-hospitalized once ) .
This difference in relapse rate was statistically significant ( Ï2=8.83 , p=0.003 ) .
BODY.DISCUSSION : 4 .
BODY.DISCUSSION.MAIN FINDINGS : 4.1 This randomized controlled trial in a large sample of individuals with schizophrenia living in both urban and rural communities that used a rigorously blinded evaluation of outcomes found that weekly training in self-management skills for six months followed by monthly booster sessions can significantly decrease relapse rates and substantially improve medication adherence and insight into the illness .
Many studies have convincingly demonstrated that low medication adherence is the main reason for high rates of relapse in individuals with chronic schizophrenia.[18],[19],[20 ] Thus any intervention than can convincingly improve medication adherence is quite important .
The large size , long follow-up , randomized design , and blind assessment of outcomes employed in this study make the identified improvement in medication compliance all the more important .
In combination with the findings of the first report from this study[9 ] â showing improved symptoms and social functioning with self-management training â this is a dramatic finding that merits widespread promulgation .
The mechanism underlying these improvements remains unclear .
The self-management intervention is associated with at least four distinct but inter-related outcomes â decreased symptoms , improved social functioning , enhanced insight about the illness , and increased adherence to medications .
At this point it is not possible ( and may never be possible ) to determine which of these four outcomes are primary and which are secondary .
It is also not possible to deconstruct the intervention to identify the active component that directly stimulates change .
In addition to the social support network engendered by the weekly group meetings in the first 6 months and monthly meetings thereafter , patients ' daily use of a detailed ' self-management journal ' can serve as a long-term , self-directed support system that encourages them to adhere to their regimen .
The daily records in the journal also help patients recognize their prodromal symptoms , negative moods , and sleeping problems , which presumably improves their insight about the illness .
BODY.DISCUSSION.LIMITATIONS : 4.2 Several issues need to be considered when assessing the importance of these rather dramatic findings .
( a ) Participants in the intervention group had substantially more contact with medical staff ( as they participated in the training ) than those in the control group so it is not possible to definitively attribute the improved outcomes to the training , it could also be due to the ' placebo effect ' of increased contact with staff members .
( b ) Assessment of medication adherence and the dosage of medication were dependent on patients ' self-reports ( not on objective measures ) .
Participants in the intervention group may have been more motivated to appear at interview as if they were compliant .
( c ) The relapse measure , defined as one or more hospitalizations , was fairly objective , but it is possible that the increased contact with staff in the intervention group â not patients ' self-management â allowed for earlier recognition and intervention to avert re-hospitalization .
( d ) The cross-sectional outcome at 30 months following-baseline may not reflect the average level of adherence and insight over the entire followup period .
( e ) The higher self-reported medication dosage at 30 months in the intervention group may not necessarily represent higher adherence because we did not assess the prescribed level of medication in the two groups .
( f ) Finally , as we pointed out in the previous report on this study,[9 ] the sample only included individuals with chronic schizophrenia who were registered in the municipal monitoring system of persons with severe mental disorder and who did not have acute symptoms ( i.e. , BPRS total score < 30 ) .
The very low attrition seen in the study ( 3.5 % over 30 months ) is likely related to their registration in the program .
Future studies with less selective samples are needed to determine the effectiveness of this selfmanagement training in the larger population of all community dwelling individuals with schizophrenia .
Some follow-up research will be need to address these limitations , but we believe that the very robust main finding of the study will remain intact even after full consideration of these potentially confounding factors .
BODY.DISCUSSION.IMPLICATIONS : 4.3 Given the generally poor outcomes and frequent relapses of individuals with chronic schizophrenia , this self-management intervention could potentially result in a major improvement in the quality of life of individuals living with schizophrenia .
We believe that the success of this program in the Chinese environment ( where almost all patients live with family members ) depends on the willingness of patients to make the effort to learn self-management skills , the support of co-resident family members , and the enthusiastic participation of mental health professionals and other medical staff .
The next step is to develop mechanisms to up-scale this intervention and to conduct cost-effectiveness studies to demonstrate the benefits of the intervention to individuals with schizophrenia , their families , and the community at large .
