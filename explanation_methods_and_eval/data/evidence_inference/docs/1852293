TITLE : The Efficacy of Vaginal Clindamycin for the Treatment of Abnormal Genital Tract Flora in Pregnancy ABSTRACT : Objective : To assess the efficacy of 2 % clindamycin vaginal cream ( CVC ) to treat bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) in pregnancy .
Methods : A prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , tricenter study .
Four hundred and four women with BV on Gram stain at their first antenatal clinic visit were randomized to receive a 3-day course of 2 % CVC or placebo .
The outcome was assessed using an intention to treat analysis at 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment according to three different diagnostic methods based on five criteria ( Gram stain and all four elements of clinical composite criteria : vaginal discharge , abnormal vaginal pH , clue cells , amine odor ) , three criteria ( vaginal pH , clue cells , amine odor ) or two criteria ( clue cells and amine odor ) to reflect stringency of diagnosis , historical precedence and government agency recommendations respectively .
Results : Using five diagnostic criteria , 18 % of CVC patients were cured and 70.8 % either cured and/or improved compared to 1.6 % and 12 % of placebo patients respectively ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Using three diagnostic criteria , 44.8 % of CVC patients were cured and 77.3 % were either cured and/or improved compared to 9.3 % and 28.8 % of placebo patients respectively ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Using two diagnostic criteria , 75.0 % of CVC patients were cured compared to 18.0 % of placebo patients ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Recurrence rates in those CVC patients successfully treated were approximately 6 % at 6 weeks post baseline and 10 % at 28 to 34 weeks gestation .
Conclusions : A 3-day course of CVC appears to be well tolerated by the mother and statistically significantly more efficacious than placebo in the treatment of BV during the second trimester of pregnancy .
