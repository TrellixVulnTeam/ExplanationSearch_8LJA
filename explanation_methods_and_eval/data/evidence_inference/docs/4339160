TITLE : The effects of kinesio taping on architecture , strength and pain of muscles in delayed onset muscle soreness of biceps brachii ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] This study aimed to confirm the effects of kinesio taping ( KT ) on muscle function and pain due to delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) of the biceps brachii .
[ Subjects and Methods ]
Thirty-seven subjects with induced DOMS were randomized into either Group I ( control , n=19 ) or Group II ( KT , n=18 ) .
Outcome measures were recorded before the intervention ( application of KT ) and at 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after the intervention .
DOMS was induced , and muscle thickness was measured using ultrasonic radiography .
Maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( % MVIC ) was measured via electromyography ( EMG ) .
Subjective pain was measured using a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
[ Results ] Group I exhibited a positive correlation between muscle thickness and elapsed time from intervention ( 24 , 48 , and 72 hours post induction of DOMS ) ; they also showed a significant decrease in MVIC(% ) .
Group II showed significant increases in muscle thickness up to the 48-hour interval post induction of DOMS , along with a significant decrease in MVIC ( % ) .
However , in contrast to Group I , Group II did not show a significant difference in muscle thickness or MVIC ( % ) at the 72-hour interval in comparison with the values prior to DOMS induction .
[ Conclusion ]
In adults with DOMS , activation of muscles by applying KT was found to be an effective and faster method of recovering muscle strength than rest alone .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) is defined as muscle injury caused by movements people are unaccustomed to , by intensive physical activity , etc1 ) .
DOMS is usually experienced within 12 hours of the offending activity , with the pain reaching a maximum in the following 48 to 72 hours , and it commonly resolves within 5 to 7 days2 ) .
Eccentric exercises are more likely to induce DOMS , movements which are rarely used in daily activities3 ) .
Muscle pain and loss of strength occur due to excessive eccentric contractions , which produce pools of intramuscular lactic acid4 ) .
Increases in muscle resting tension also temporarily alter muscle function5 ) .
DOMS manifests as limitations of range of motion ( ROM ) , swelling , reduced muscle strength , increased muscle thickness , and limited functional movement6,7,8 ) .
Taping has been used in general to protect joints , reduce swelling , and stabilize joints following acute injuries9 ) .
Elastic kinesio taping ( KT ) of muscle is effective for pain control due to increases in both blood and lymph circulations10 ) .
It is used for earlier recovery of muscle strength after exercise11 ) .
Muscle thickness is a measure of muscle function that is taken using ultrasound while the muscle is actively contracting12 ) .
Electromyography ( EMG ) is used to assess the functional changes in muscle7 , 13 ) .
A visual analogue scale ( VAS ) is also used to assess subjective changes in pain experienced14 ) .
The objective of this study , therefore , was to ascertain how KT affects the thickness and % MVIC of muscle , and subjective pain experienced , as caused by induced DOMS , at different times of measurement .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS.SUBJECTS : This study was conducted with male participants in their twenties .
The inclusion criteria were as follows : no orthopedic problems in the preceding 6 months , no cardiovascular problems , no medications that may affect performance or measurement , no limitation in ROM , andright-handed dominant side .
All of the subjects voluntarily consented to participate in this study .
Data collection was initiated after approval was obtained from the Dongshin University Institutional Review Board ( BM-006 - 01 ) .
The general characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1Table 1.Characteristics of study participantsParametersGroup I (n=19)Group II (n=18)Age (years)23.5±1.222.5±1.4Height (cm)169.1±3.1171.4±3.6Weight (kg)65.1±3.766.5±5.0All data are expressed as means with standard deviations ( SDs ) .
Group I , control ; Group II , kinesio taping .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS.METHODS : Out of the 50 participants , only 37 experienced DOMS following the procedure outlined below .
These 37 were then grouped into Group I ( control , no treatment , n=19 ) and Group II ( KT , n=18 ) by picking up a ball with either group labeled on it .
Dumbbells to elicit 70 % of maximal isometric muscle strength ( 1 RM ) of each subject were used to induce DOMS in the following way .
With their nondominant arms on a table , the subjects were asked to flex their shoulders to 45 degrees , and elbows to 90 degrees and to maintain this position for 3 seconds .
Following this , they slowly extended their elbows to the fully extended position .
After full extension , they were passively returned to the starting position of 90 degrees of elbow flexion .
This exercise was performed for 7 sets of 10 repetitions per set .
The subjects were rested for 1 minute between sets15 ) .
In Group II , KT was applied to the biceps brachii on the nondominant side in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers .
Ultrasonography ( Sonoace X49900 , Medison , Seoul , South Korea ) was used to measure muscle thickness .
This was measured at the midpoint of the muscle belly , which was calculated to be at a point 30 % of the way along the biceps muscle and proximal to the elbow joint .
The measurement was taken with the subject sitting and the elbow fully extended .
For measurement of the maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( % MVIC ) , a surface EMG ( BTS Pocket EMG , BTS S.p .
A.,Milan , Italy ) was used .
Data were collected with subjects sitting and the elbow flexed to 90 degrees against resistance .
The sample collection rate was 1,000 Hz , and filtering was 20 to 500 Hz .
A VAS was used to assess subjective pain level .
Each session was repeated 3 times with a 1 minute break between sessions .
Outcome measures were collected a total of 4 times , before the intervention and at 24 , 48 , and 72 hour postintervention .
For statistical analysis , SPSS 12.0 for Windows was used .
Comparison between groups at different times was performed by one-way repeated measure ANOVA .
When a significant difference was found , a contrast test was performed .
The statistical significance level was set at α=0.05 .
BODY.RESULTS : Upon analysis of muscle thickness and MVIC ( % ) before and after induced DOMS , Group I showed increases in muscle thickness and decreases in MVIC ( % ) over time ( p<0.001 ) .
Group II mirrored the increase in muscle thickness and decrease in MVIC ( % ) up to the 48 hour interval post induction of DOMS ( p<0.001 ) , but at the 72 hour interval , the measurements obtained showed no significant difference in muscle thickness and MVIC ( % ) for Group II when compared with those from before induction of DOMS ( p>0.05 ) ( Tables 2 and 3Table 2.The changes of muscle thickness (cm)−24 h24 h48 h72 hGroup I1.20±0.181.48±0.11a)***1.50±0.12b)***1.41±0.11c)***Group II1.30±0.971.51±1.56a)***1.58±0.4b)***1.31±0.11All values are shown as the mean±SD .

BODY.DISCUSSION : Delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) after excessive or unaccustomed use of muscles can occur in anyone16 ) .
It is related to inflammation resulting from damage to muscle and connective tissue17 ) .
KT reduces pain via mechanical stimulation18 ) .
It is also known to be effective in the restoration of ROM and muscle strength19 ) .
KT maintains consistent muscle tension and further improves muscle function by enhancing stability20 ) .
The aim of this study was to find out how KT influences muscle thickness , MVIC ( % ) , and subjective pain in adults with deliberately induced DOMS 24 hours , 48 hours , and 72 hours postintervention .
To properly assess muscle function , it is important to compare and analyze muscle with ultrasound21 ) .
This makes it possible to assess characteristics of muscle such as size , thickness , shape , and function8 ) .
Muscle thickness is an especially important gauge of the mechanical properties of muscle and the changes that are occurring to inner structures22 ) .
After induction of DOMS , muscle thickness in both Group I and II showed increases at the 24 hour and 48 hour intervals .
At the 72 hour interval , Group II showed a muscle thickness that was similar to the measurements obtained before induced DOMS .
We believe this to be due to KT stimulating γ-motor neurons within skeletal muscle with a subsequent effect on resting muscle tension .
DOMS causes reduced muscle function and damages muscle fibers more in eccentric contractions than concentric ones23 ) .
Surface EMG analyzes the electrical activity of individual muscles and provides information about changes in motor control24 ) .
Changes in muscle function are measured via % MVIC7 ) .
Following induction of DOMS , Group II had decreases in MVIC ( % ) at 24 and 48 hours intervals , although MVIC ( % ) recovered by the 72 hour interval .
Group I showed significant decreases in MVIC ( % ) at all intervals .
We believe this to be due to metabolic problems occurring within the muscle due to the increase in muscle thickness , the buildup of cellular waste products , and to a decrease in contractility as a result of myofiber microtrauma .
We also believe that the recovery of altered tissues in Group II was facilitated by KT due to its elastic nature , which raises the skin and muscle fascia .
Changes in subjective pain levels were measured by VAS15 ) .
Both Group I and Group II with induced DOMS showed increased pain levels 24 hours after the intervention , reaching a maximum 48 hours post intervention and decreasing at the 72 hour mark .
We propose that this proves that elastic KT is effective in reducing pain .
We further suggest that this will have a positive psychological effect and hasten the return to daily routine ( Table 4Table 4.The changes of VAS (scores)−24 h24 h48 h72 hGroup I05.29±1.375.86±0.134.52±1.36Group II05.07±1.285.74±0.172.19±0.23a)***All values are shown as the mean±SD .

In conclusion , elastic KT was found to reduce pain by improving muscle function and strength , as it provides an environment conducive to recovery .
It achieves this by activating muscles with DOMS .
KT was found to be an important modality in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders .
