TITLE : The Higher Response of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Angiotensin-II to Human Chorionic Gonadotropin in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : This research investigated the response of vascular active factors , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and angiotensin-II ( AT-II ) to ovarian stimulation during 24 hours in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) .
ABSTRACT.MATERIALS AND METHODS : In this clinical trial study , 52 patients with PCOS and 8 control cases were stimulated with human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) on the 4th to 7th day of the patients ' natural or induced menstrual cycles .
We measured VEGF and AT-II by radioimmunoassay before the injection ( 0 hour ) and 3 , 8 , 12 , 18 and 24 hours after the stimulation .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : After ovarian stimulation , there was substantially higher level of VEGF in typical PCOS patients than the other three groups at the 3 hour time point ( p<0.05 ) , while there were no significant differences in VEGF at all the other time points among the four groups .
As for AT-II , before and at all time points after the ovarian stimulation , it seemed that the AT-II levels in patients ' sera with different phenotypes of PCOS by the Rotterdam criteria were all higher than in the control group although the differences were not statistically significant .
The level of AT-II in typical PCOS patients was also significantly higher than the other three groups at the 3 hour time point ( p<0.05 ) , while no significant differences at all the other time points among the four groups were observed .
ABSTRACT.CONCLUSION : The response to the stimulation varied among patients with different phenotypes of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria .
Serum VEGF and AT-II were possible contributors to an increased risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) in patients with typical PCOS during the early follicular phase ( 3 hours ) after ovarian stimulation ( Registration Number : NCT02265861 ) .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) is a complex and common gynecological endocrine disorder that occurs in 5 - 10 % of reproductive women ( 1 ) .
In China , this disorder is found in 50 - 60 % of outpatients in gynecologic endocrinopathy clinics ( 2 ) .
It is characterized by a polycystic ovary , ovarian hyperandrogenism ( HA ) , and anovulation although there are several different phenotypes of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria ( 3 ) .
A key pathophysiological feature of PCOS is an increase in ovarian mass caused by new blood vessel proliferation in the stroma and theca interna ( 4 ) .
Ultrasonographic assessment of the stromal area and blood flow is currently used as a diagnostic test ( 5 ) .
In ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) , massive ovarian enlargement has been reported with PCOS as one of its risk factors ( 6 ) .
Vascular active factors , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , angiotensin-II ( AT-II ) , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , and some cytokines may be involved which have certain relevance for PCOS pathophysiology ( 7 ) .
Ovarian stimulation may change the production of vascular active factors and different phenotypes of PCOS may have different responses to the stimulation .
VEGF is a 46 kd dimeric protein .
Its expression is increased where vascular proliferation is active .
The most important sources of VEGF in the female reproductive system are local macrophages and granulosa cells , and the production of VEGF can be increased by human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) ( 8) .
VEGF is one of the most likely candidates for promoting angiogenesis in PCOS and OHSS .
The serum VEGF level is increased both in the patients with PCOS and OHSS ( 9 ) .
The increased number of actively secreting granulosa lutein cells and the increased secretory capacity of each granulosa cell both contribute to excessive VEGF production ( 10 ) .
In PCOS , the Renin-Angiotensin System ( RAS ) is accentuated .
The roles of AT-II have been proposed in growth and atresia of follicles , oocyte maturation , ovulation , corpus luteum formation , steroidogenesis , and corpus luteum regression ( 11 ) .
The level of AT-II in peripheral blood is higher in PCOS patients than in non-PCOS women .
AT-II concentration is positively correlated with the level of testosterone ( T ) in PCOS patients ( 12 ) .
Therefore , components of the RAS , such as AT-II , may be involved in PCOS pathophysiology .
VEGF and AT-II belong to different molecular systems , however both can act as vascular active factors .
The aim of this study is to investigate whether ovarian stimulation increases serum vascular active factors such as VEGF and AT-II within 24 hours after stimulation in patients with PCOS during the early follicular phase .
BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS : This clinical trial study enrolled women with or without PCOS who entered an in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) program at the hospital affiliated to the Medical School of Nanjing University .
This research was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the school and informed consent was obtained from the participating subjects .
A total of 60 women were recruited and divided into four groups by the Rotterdam criteria according to three typical characteristics : 1 .
biochemical characteristics of HA , 2 .
chronic anovulation , and 3 .
polycystic ovarian morphology ( PCO ) .
Group 1 ( typical PCOS ) was composed of 21 women who had all three of the above features , group 2 ( PCOS without PCO ) included 14 women with both biochemical characteristics of HA and chronic anovulation , group 3 ( PCOS without HA ) included 17 women with both chronic anovulation and PCO , and group 4 consisted of 8 volunteers without any biochemical characteristics of HA , chronic anovulation or PCO .
This group served as the controls for the three PCOS groups .
No patients were prescribed any hormonal prescriptions during the three months preceding the study .
The clinical manifestations and the basic data are shown in table 1 .
An ovarian stimulation test , which mimicked the common ovulation protocol ( 10 ) was performed by the administration of a single intramuscular ( i.m . ) injection of HCG ( 5000 IU , The First Biochemical Pharmapeutic , Shanghai , China ) during the early follicular phase of the same menstrual cycle ( 4th to 7th day of the cycle ) .
Blood samples from all subjects were collected immediately prior to the injection ( H0 ) , and at 3 ( H1 ) , 8 ( H2 ) , 12 ( H3 ) , 18 ( H4 ) , and 24 ( H5 ) hours after the injection .
The serum was stored at -80 ̊C until further analyses of VEGF and AT-II levels by immunoradioassay .
Concentrations of androstenedione ( A ) , T and estradiol ( E2 ) at H0 were also measured .

BODY.MATERIALS AND METHODS.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Tests were two-sided and conducted at α < 0.05 .
In general , the methods for the multiple comparisons were based on analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) to identify group differences with the Bonferroni correction when appropriate .
Logarithmic transformation of data was performed for data that were not normally distributed .
For all analyses , a two-tailed p<0.05 was considered statistically significant .
Unless otherwise noted , all results were described as mean ± SD .
Correlations were examined by linear regression analysis .
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 11.0 software package for Windows .
BODY.RESULTS : The subject characteristics of the four groups are summarized in table 1 .
Among the groups there were no differences in age , body mass index ( BMI ) and waist to hip ratio ( WHR ) .
There were significantly higher T , A , and E2 levels of the PCOS groups compared to the control group ( Table 1 ) .
Before ovarian stimulation , there were no significant differences in VEGF between the four groups ( Fig 1A ) .
After ovarian stimulation , the level of VEGF in the typical PCOS patients ( Group 1 ) was substantially higher than the other three groups at the 3 hour time point ( p<0.05 ) , while there were no significant differences in VEGF at the other time points among the four groups ( Fig 1A ) .
As for AT-II , before and at all time points after ovarian stimulation , it appeared that AT-II levels in the patients ' sera with different phenotypes of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria were all higher than in the control group ( Fig 1B ) , however these differences were not statistically significant .
The level of AT-II in typical PCOS patients ( Group 1 ) was also significantly higher than the other three groups at the 3 hour time point ( p<0.05 ) , while no significant differences at all the other time points among the four groups ( Fig 1B ) were observed .

BODY.DISCUSSION : Abnormal expression of VEGF , accompanied by abnormal angiogenesis and vascular permeability has been suggested as a cause of several diseases including PCOS and OHSS ( 13 - 16 ) .
Increased secretion of VEGF in the serum of patients with PCOS may be induced as a result of an increased number of actively secreting granulosa lutein cells that have both increased secretory capacity and upregulated gene expression level ( 17 ) .
The expression level of VEGF is increased in the hyper-echogenic stroma of PCOS and it induces subsequent stroma growth by promoting microvascular permeability ( 18 , 19 ) .
Androgen is secreted in the theca interna and the latter will grow abnormally where vascular proliferation is active .
VEGF can affect vascular endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability ( 20 ) .
PCOS is one of the risk factors of OHSS ( 21 ) .
The significance of VEGF is its contribution to the induction and progression of OHSS during ovarian induction .
VEGF has also been suggested to be responsible for OHSS which is an iatrogenic and potentially life-threatening complication of ovulation induction for the treatment of infertility .
Our findings have demonstrated that ovarian stimulation increased VEGF expression during the early follicular phase of typical PCOS patients , which indicated that VEGF might be directly involved in OHSS pathogenesis ( 22 ) .
Despite the fact that OHSS occurs in the luteal phase after ovarian induction , we have proposed that VEGF should be monitored during the early follicular phase .
However , in this study , the level of VEGF in the PCOS without PCO or HA did not significantly increase .
This phenomenon has demonstrated that the responsiveness of patients with typical PCOS to ovarian stimulation was greater than that of the PCOS without PCO or HA .
As we know , women of both typical PCOS and PCOS without HA are at higher risks for OHSS ( 23 ) .
However according to our observation , the VEGF response patterns in these two groups differed ; group 1 was more sensitive than group 3 .
This phenomenon may suggest that the typical PCOS is more severe than the phenotypic PCOS .
Further research is needed to clarify this phenomenon .
AT-II plays an important role in RAS and it affects the reproduction cycle at different stages ( 24 ) .
Disturbances in ovarian RAS can be the cause or the result of such reproductive disorders as PCOS and OHSS .
Our data have demonstrated that ovarian stimulation led to AT-II expression in patients with typical PCOS .
Consistent with a previous report , AT-II might play an important role in PCOS pathophysiology ( 25 ) .
AT-II has been shown to modulate the local functions of ovaries , such as ovarian steroidogenesis and formation of the corpus luteum , in addition to stimulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation via AT-II receptors on granulosa cells ( 26 ) .
In addition to the circulating RAS , the ovary has been recently demonstrated to exhibit its own RAS products and activities .
Such an intrinsic RAS can modulate the local functions of ovaries such as follicular development , ovulation , and formation of the corpus luteum ( 27 ) .
As AT-II is mainly produced by follicular theca cells and granulosa lutein cells ( 28 ) , patients with PCOS have a higher risk of developing OHSS because of exogenous gonadotropin for ovulation induction .
Results of these studies indicate that RAS is more active in the ovaries of PCOS patients .
Although OHSS occurs during the luteal phases , the current study was performed during the follicular phase .
Ovarian stimulation increased the AT-II levels during the follicular phase in PCOS patients .
These results , taken together with other parallel studies ( 29 ) , led us to consider serum AT-II as a possible contributor to a greater risk of OHSS in patients with PCOS during ovulation induction .
Inhibition of RAS , commensurate with the changes of serum AT-II concentrations , might be used as a therapeutic approach .
BODY.CONCLUSION : In conclusion , the response of the ovaries to HCG stimulation differs in patients with different phenotypes of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria .
The typical PCOS is more severe than the phenotypic PCOS .
Further research is needed to clarify this phenomenon .
Serum VEGF and AT-II levels may be considered as biomarkers to predict risks of developing OHSS in patients with typical PCOS during the early follicular phase , at 3 hours after ovarian stimulation .
