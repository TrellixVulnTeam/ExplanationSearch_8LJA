TITLE : Wii Fit balance training or progressive balance training in patients with chronic stroke : a randomised controlled trial ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ]
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Wii Fit balance training ( WBT ) and progressive balance training ( PBT ) approaches on balance functions , balance confidence , and activities of daily living in chronic stroke patients .
[ Subjects ] A total of 30 patients were randomized into the WBT ( n=15 ) and PBT ( n=15 ) groups .
[ Methods ] All of the subjects received exercise training based on a neurodevelopemental approach in addition to either Wii Fit or progressive balance training for total of 1 hour a day , 3 days per week for 4 weeks .
Primary measurements were static balance function measured with a Wii Balance Board and dynamic balance function assessed with the Berg Balance Scale , Timed Up and Go test , Dynamic Gait Index , and Functional Reach Test .
Secondary measures were balance confidence assessed with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale and activities of daily living evaluated with the Frenchay Activity Index .
[ Results ] There was not remarkable difference between the two treatments in dynamic balance functions , balance confidence , and activities of daily living .
[ Conclusion ] Although both of the approaches were found to be effective in improving the balance functions , balance confidence , and activities of daily living , neither of them were more preferable than the other for the treatment of balance in patients with chronic stroke .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : World stroke incidence studies have shown that there has been a 42 % decrease in stroke incidence in high-income countries and more than a 100 % increase in low-to middle-income countries .
Early stroke case fatality has decreased in both high-income and low-to middle-income countries1 ) .
Despite the increase in stroke incidence , the decrease in mortality rate leads to an increase in people living with disabilities .
Therefore , stroke constitutes the leading cause of serious , complex , and long-term adult disability2 , 3 ) .
Although 15–30 % of the stroke survivors become permanently disabled , 50–70 % of stroke patients regains functional independence and mostly regains walking ability4 , 5 ) .
Due to residual functional disabilities such as impaired balance and motor weakness , patients with stroke may walk with an abnormal pattern .
A study by Jorgensen et al. showed that 73 % stroke patients fell in the six months after a stroke , that 21 % fell after 6 months , and that over half of all reported falls occurred during walking activities due to problems such as loss of balance , misjudgement , and foot dragging6,7,8 ) .
Balance deficits like reduced postural stability during quiet standing , delayed and less coordinated responses to internal and external balance perturbations , and increased weight bearing on the unaffected limb are one of the main risk factors for falls after stroke9,10,11 ) .
Together with the increased risk of falling , fear of falling increases , self-confidence decreases , and individual autonomy and participation in social activities reduces .
Therefore , patients become more dependent on caregivers , and as a result , quality of life decreases .
The rehabilitation approaches aiming to increase the balance functions of patients promotes reintegration into the community , recreational and daily life activities , positive behavioral changes , and social acceptance of the patients12 , 13 ) .
Balance rehabilitation programs after stroke were found to be effective in enhancing functional recovery ; on the other hand , the limited resources of health-care systems hamper the implementation of intensive practice14 , 15 ) .
Therefore , innovative rehabilitation technologies including virtual reality systems are currently being used in stroke rehabilitation mainly because they provide an enriched environment , task-specific goals , and repetitive practice16 , 17 ) .
These systems may decrease the amount of time spent for one-to-one sessions with physiotherapists and may provide patients with the opportunity to use the systems at home .
Currently , Nintendo Wii Fit , video game technology using virtual reality , has become a very popular rehabilitation approach in balance treatment .
In the Wii Fit games , patients are directed to shift their weight anteriorly , posteriorly , and laterally within a center of pressure ( COP ) range in order to reach a target and to enhance their limits of stability .
The Wii Fit games have been used in the literature due to their effects in improving motor skills and postural control by using visual-perceptual systems , providing information about the performance , showing the direction , speed and acceleration changes , and being interactive , motivating , useful and cheap18,19,20 ) .
Few studies have used the Wii Fit method for balance treatment in chronic stroke patients .
Two case report studies have demonstrated that static and dynamic balance can be improved with the Wii Fit system in patients with stroke21 , 22 ) .
In a previous randomized controlled study in which standard rehabilitation plus virtual reality balance training with Wii Fit was compared with standard rehabilitation only greater improvement was observed in dynamic balance23 ) .
This may be because of the disparity in the duration ( length of session ) and intensity ( massed practice ) of the treatment in the two groups .
Therefore , it was expecting that more improvement would be obtained in the experimental group due to more intensive treatment .
The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of game technology based Wii Fit balance training ( WBT ) and progressive balance training ( PBT ) in addition to a neurodevelopmental treatment program on static and dynamic balance functions , activity specific balance confidence , and activities of daily living in patients with chronic stroke .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Individuals with stroke admitted to a physiotherapy and rehabilitation department over a period of 12 months were considered for inclusion in this study .
The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee for Medical , Surgery and Drug Research ( LUT 11/01 ) , and written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to data collection .
Thirty-three patients with chronic stroke enrolled in the rehabilitation program .
The criterion for inclusion was first ever stroke with hemiparesis ( ≥ 6 months ) .
Patients were excluded if they had any other physical problem or epilepsy , moderate to severe cognitive deficits as evaluated by the Mini Mental State Examination test ( MMSE ) ( ≤20 points ) , severe depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) ( ≥30 points ) , and were unable to walk independently according to the Modified Rankin Scale ( MRS ) ( > 3 points ) .
Participants were randomly allocated to one of two different treatment groups : PBT and WBT .
A simple randomization method was used to allocate patients in each group according to registration number ( even numbers , PBT group ; odd numbers , WBT group ) .
Figure 1Fig .
1.Study profile shows the patient profile for the study .
A neurodevelopmental treatment , a problem solving and analytical approach , was applied to each group .
The treatment programs were planned considering the functional level , individual needs , and demands of the patients based on selective movement as a basis of functional activity and successful goal acquisition24 ) .
The details of the NDT are given in Appendix 1 .
Patients assigned to the WBT group received a 1 hour treatment program consisting of a 30-minute neurodevelopmental training program and 30-minute Wii balance training program for a total of 12 sessions , which were held 3 days a week for 4 weeks .
The details of the WBT are given in Appendix 2 .
Patients assigned to the PBT group received a 1 hour treatment program consisting of a 30-minute neurodevelopmental training program and 30-minute progressive balance training program for a total of 12 sessions , which were held 3 days a week for 4 weeks .
The details of the PBT are given in Appendix 3 .
The descriptive variables of the patients including age , gender , body mass index , duration of stroke , and affected side were recorded before the treatment .
All participants were assessed at baseline ( week 0 ) , after the treatment ( week 4 ) , and one month post treatment ( week 8) .
Primary measurements were static and dynamic balance function tests .
The static balance , that is the mediolateral weight distribution on the paretic and nonparetic extremities , was measured with a Wii Balance Board ( WBB ) , which has characteristics similar to laboratory-based force platform ( FP ) systems that contain four transducers used to assess weight distribution and COP25 ) .
Dynamic balance was measured with four balance tests reflecting different aspects of balance : the Berg Balance Scale , Timed Up and Go Test , Dynamic Gait Index , and Functional Reach Test .
The Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , which is a psychometrically sound measure of balance impairment post stroke , was used to assess functional balance of the patients26 , 27 ) .
The test is a 14-item objective measure used to assess the balance performance of patients during functional tasks ranging from sitting to standing on one foot28 ) .
The Timed Up and Go Test ( TUG ) was used to measure the functional mobility level of the patients .
The time taken to complete the task ( standing up from a chair , walking 3 meters , turning around , walking back , and sitting down ) was recorded in this test29 , 30 ) .
The Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) , which assesses an individual 's ability to modify balance while walking in the presence of external demands , was used to assess balance and gait ability of the patients31 , 32 ) .
The Functional Reach Test ( FRT ) , which consists of measurement of the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm 's length while maintaining a fixed base of support in the standing position , was used to measure the stability limits of the patients33 ) .
The secondary measures were balance confidence and activities of daily living .
The balance confidence of the patients was measured with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence ( ABC ) scale developed to measure the confidence of subjects when performing various ambulatory activities without falling34 ) .
The activities of daily living of the patients were evaluated with the Frenchay Activity Index ( FAI ) , which contains 3 factors ( indoor domestic activities , outdoor domestic activities and outdoor social activities ) related to the self care and mobility of patients35 ) .
We calculated that the required sample size was 30 subjects for 90 % power with a 5 % significance level .
The results were analyzed with the SPSS 15.00 software program .
The variables are presented as the mean ± standard deviation ( X ± SD ) .
The differences within groups were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test , and those between groups were tested using the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test .
The Friedman test was used for repeated measurements , and Bonferroni correction was used to assess changes in balance functions from week 0 to week 8 between the groups .
The 95 % level of confidence ( α = 0.05 , or the margin of error ) was used for the assumptions to identify differences in the variance analysis .
BODY.RESULTS : Forty patients were assessed during the study period .
Of these , 33 patients were recruited and randomly allocated into the WBT ( n=17 ) and PBT ( n=16 ) groups .
Reasons for exclusions and drop-outs are shown in the study profile ( Fig. 1 ) .
Fifteen patients in the PBT group and fifteen patients in the WBT group completed the 4-week treatment program and the follow-up assessment at 8 weeks .
Before treatment , there were no significant differences between the WBT and PBT groups with respect to demographic characteristics , mental state , and level of depression .
However , disease severity measured by the Modified Rankin Scale was found to be higher in the PBT group ( Table 1Table 1.Demographical and physical characteristics of patientsWBT(n=15)(X±SD)PBT(n=15)(X±SD)GenderMale67Female98Affected sideRight87Left 78Age (years)Mean62.8056.60SD10.8716.42Body mass index (kg/m2)Mean29.1428.30SD4.524.56Duration (years)Mean3.704.23SD4.424.86Modified Rankin Scale (0–6)Mean1.802.40*SD0.770.82Mini Mental Test (0–30)Mean22.8622.26SD2.382.05Beck Depression Inventory (0–63)Mean14.0014.00SD6.147.58*p≤0.05 ) .
The functional balance performance scores of the patients in the WBT group were higher for the BBS and TUG tests performed before treatment ( week 0 ) .
The results of the four different functional balance tests ( BBS , TUG , DGI , and FRT ) showed that both groups improved significantly after treatment ( week 4 ) .
However , there was no significant difference between the groups after treatment ( week 4 ) .
The patients in the PBT group showed a significantly lower results of the BBS and TUG tests in their follow-up measurements ( week 8) ( Table 2Table 2.Within-and between-group comparisons of all outcome measuresWeek 0X±SDWeek 4X±SDWeek 8X±SDWeek 0 vs. 4(Wilcoxon test)Week 4 vs. 8(Wilcoxon test)Weight distribution (%)WBTParetic44.04±7.4748.00±2.8046.64±4.40*Nonparetic55.88±7.4552.00±2.8053.36±4.41*PBTParetic 47.54±10.1648.59±8.3848.14±8.94Nonparetic52.46±10.1651.27±8.3651.86±8.94WBT vs PBT(Mann-Whitney U test ) ( Friedman test ) BBS (0–56)WBT45.60±5.2650.33±4.0950.33±4.16*PBT39.60±9.3144.80±7.4844.20±7.77**WBT vs. PBT(Mann-Whitney U test)***(Friedman test)*TUG (sec)WBT 17.96±7.7716.17±8.2315.95±7.93*PBT26.36±11.6022.11±11.8822.73±11.95**WBT vs PBT(Mann-Whitney U test)*(Friedman test ) *

Both groups showed significant improvement in terms of the balance confidence ( ABC ) scale from baseline to after the treatment period ( week 4 ) .
No significant difference was recorded between the two groups after treatment ( weeks 4 and 8) ( Table 2 ) .
The activities of daily living measured with the FAI were found to be increased in both groups after treatment ( week 4 ) .
When comparing the groups , no significant differences were found between them after treatment ( weeks 4 and 8) .
The results at follow-up showed that ADL continued to improve in the PBT group despite cessation of treatment ( week 8) ( Table 2 ) .
BODY.DISCUSSION : The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of balance training with an increasingly popular virtual reality based game technology , Nintendo Wii Fit ( WBT ) , and progressive balance training ( PBT ) on balance functions , activity specific balance confidence , and activities of daily living in patients with chronic stroke .
Although the two approaches tend to be more effective on different parameters of functional balance measures , there were no remarkable superiorities of either treatment approach over the other .
On the basis of the idea that visual feedback , which was used more intensely in the Wii Fit group , would have additional effects on symmetrical weight bearing on the paretic and nonparetic extremities36 ) , the effects of the two treatment approaches on symmetrical weight distribution were compared in our study .
Although the weight bearing on the paretic extremity was found to be improved and was more symmetrical in the WBT group , no significant superiority of either treatment method over the other was observed for the weight distribution of the patients .
We speculate that the results might be due to the baseline weight distribution of the patients in our study .
The average weight distribution of the patients on the nonparetic extremity at the beginning of this study was relatively symmetrical ( 52–55 % ) compared with the values specified for stroke patients in the literature (61–80%)11 ) .
Moreover , the weight distribution was more symmetrical in the PBT group ( 52 % ) than in the WBT group ( 55 % ) ; thus the effects of the treatment methods might not have emerged exactly .
The balance exercises used in both treatment methods included weight shifting activities closely related to static balance , i.e. , the ability to maintain a chosen posture with minimal postural sway10 ) .
These exercises aims to improve postural control by increasing anteroposterior and mediolateral weight transfer and reducing postural sway , but do not especially focus on improving dynamic balance .
As postural control is a prerequisite for most functional activities , weight shifting exercises aimed at improving postural control , may have significant effects on balance during functional activities .
All of the functional balance measurements ( BBS , TUG , DGI , and FRT ) applied to the patients for that purpose showed that functional performance was improved in both groups .
We supposed that training approaches emphasizing weight shifting abilities , whether using visual feedback ( WBT ) or not ( PBT ) , provides benefits to both static and dynamic aspects of balance .
The measurements after 8 weeks showed that there was a decline in the BBS and TUG test results in the PBT group .
In a case-control report of Deutsch et al. , two individuals in the chronic phase post stroke received balance training with either a Nintendo Wii and Wii Fit program or standard of care balance and mobility program for 12 training ( 60-minute ) sessions , and it was found that the patient who received the standard therapy maintained his improvements after treatment .
It was propounded that the activities used for the treatment ( balance and coordination exercises and outdoor activities e.g. crossing the road , walking in the busy areas , and market shopping ) were transferred to real life activities due to the similarity between them , and thus the patient had used these activities after treatment22 ) .
Considering the activities of the study mentioned above , we did not include outdoor activities in addition to the balance exercises in our study ; this may constitute a reason why the improvements were not maintained after treatment in our study .
' Balance confidence ' , defined as the perceived ability or confidence to perform an activity or action without falling37 ) , was found in our study to be improved in both groups after treatment .
Bandura 's theory identifies four factors affecting self-efficacy , that is , one 's belief in one 's ability to succeed in specific situations : performance accomplishments ( physical practice ) , vicarious experience ( mental practice ) , verbal persuasion ( encouragement ) , and emotional sources (motivation)38 ) .
Associating these factors with falls-related self-efficacy , it can be said that both the PBT and WBT approaches may involve adequate physical practice , mental practice , encouragement , and motivation , which lead to improved balance confidence in patients .
The results for activities of daily living results indicate that the patients in both groups improved after treatment .
In addition to this result , improvements in the PBT group proceeded after the cessation of treatment ( week 8) .
It is known that the Wii Fit balance training method includes task-specific activities , though Wii Fit exercises are not very similar to daily life activities in many ways .
Patients may perceive the Wii Fit activities as ' games ' , therefore , even though there are improvements in functional balance , these activities do not contribute to the transfer of improvements to daily life activities .
In a further aspect , progressive balance training is more similar to daily life activities , and patients may perceive PBT activities as ' training ' rather than a ' games ' , therefore , PBT may result in more improvement in patients ' daily lives .
The limitations of this study include the fact that , the feedback given with Wii Fit may not be sufficient for patients to use normal movement strategies ; therefore , physiotherapists should prevent abnormal patterns during activities .
In another way , during the Wii Fit training , the need for a physiotherapist to help with symmetrical weight shifting poses a problem with respect to use of this technology at home .
The main aim of this study was to use Wii Fit technology in order to reduce the need for one-to-one interaction between physiotherapist and patients ; however , if there is a necessity for physiotherapists to correct the abnormal patters used by patients , it should be questioned whether this technology can be used at home or not .
This study found that physiotherapist-assisted Wii Fit balance training is an effective method , but there is a need to compare the effects of Wii Fit balance training with and without any help from physiotherapists in future studies .
Another limitation of this study was the disease severity , which was found to be higher in the PBT group .
This limitation was due to the randomization procedure ; therefore it could not be eliminated .
Some studies have asserted that although there are beneficial effects of using Wii Fit in rehabilitation , this technology may have some safety problems .
Like the other commercial game systems , the Wii Fit system is a ' black box ' ; thus various parameters of the system can not be controlled .
In this sense , not being a rehabilitation-specific tool , being difficult for people with physical problems , allowing the use of abnormal movement patterns , having an incomprehensible scoring system , giving feedback that is not rehabilitation specific , and making degrading comments sometimes are some problems preventing the Wii Fit system from becoming widely used in rehabilitation22 , 39 ) .
There are also reports of injuries arising from the use of Nintendo Wii game systems ( metacarpal and metatarsal fractures , wrist and ankle traumas , clavicular fracture , patellar dislocation , muscle and tendon injuries , C7 fracture , stroke , and hemothorax ) in the literature40,41,42,43,44,45,46 ) .
In this sense , there were no negative effects and/or any injuries attributable to use of Wii Fit in our study .
To our knowledge , this is the first study comparing the effectiveness of Wii Fit balance training ( WBT ) and progressive balance training ( PBT ) in addition to neurodevelopmental treatment approaches in patients with chronic stroke .
The two treatment programs used in the current study were both found to be effective on balance functions , activity-specific balance confidence , and activities of daily living .
When comparing the two treatment approaches , they seem to be effective on different parameters of balance performance , with no superiorities of either treatment approach over the other .
Wii Fit balance treatment can be used as an effective method for patients with difficulty accessing treatment or for physiotherapists who require alternative methods of treatment .
