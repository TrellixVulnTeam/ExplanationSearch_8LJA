TITLE : The effect of randomised exposure to different types of natural outdoor environments compared to exposure to an urban environment on people with indications of psychological distress in Catalonia ABSTRACT.INTRODUCTION : Experimental studies have reported associations between short-term exposure to natural outdoor environments ( NOE ) and health benefits .
However , they lack insight into mechanisms , often have low external and ecological validity , and have rarely focused on people with some psycho-physiological affection .
The aim of this study was to use a randomized , case-crossover design to investigate : ( i ) the effects of unconstrained exposure to real natural and urban environments on psycho-physiological indicators of people with indications of psychological distress , ( ii ) the possible differential effects of 30 and 30 + 180 minutes exposures , and ( iii ) the possible mechanisms explaining these effects .
ABSTRACT.MATERIAL AND METHODS : People ( n = 26 ) with indications of psychological distress were exposed to green ( Collserola Natural Park ) , blue ( Castelldefels beach ) and urban ( Eixample neighbourhood ) environments in Catalonia .
They were exposed to all environments in groups for a period of 30 + 180 minutes between October 2013 and January 2014 .
During the exposure period , participants were instructed to do what they would usually do in that environment .
Before , during ( at 30 and 30 + 180 minutes ) and after each exposure , several psycho-physiological measures were taken : mood ( measured as Total Mood Disturbance , TMD ) , attention capacity ( measured as backwards digit-span task ) , stress levels ( measures as salivary cortisol ) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , autonomous nervous system ( assessed as heart rate variability and the indicators : low frequency power ( LF ) , high frequency power ( HF ) , ratio between LF and HF ( LF : HF ) , and coefficients of component variance of LF , HF , and LF : HF ) .
We also measured several potential mediators : air pollution , noise , physical activity , social interactions , and self-perceived restoration experience .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : When compared with responses to urban environment , we found statistically significantly lower TMD [ -4.78 ( -7.77 , -1.79 ) points difference ] , and salivary cortisol [ -0.21 ( -0.34 , -0.08 ) log nmol/L ] in the green exposure environment , and statistically significantly lower TMD [ -4.53 ( -7.57 , -1.49 ) points difference ] , and statistically significant favourable changes in heart rate variability indicators ( specifically LF : HF and CCV-LF : HF with around -0.20 points of difference of the indicators ) in the blue exposure environment .
Physical activity and self-perceived restoration experience partially mediated the associations between NOE and TMD .
Physical activity and air pollution partially mediated the associations between NOE and heart rate variability .
ABSTRACT.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS : This study extends the existing evidence on the benefits of NOE for people 's health .
It also suggests NOE potential as a preventive medicine , specifically focusing on people with indications of psychological distress .
ABSTRACT.TRIAL REGISTRATION : Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02624921 BODY.INTRODUCTION : In experimental studies , short-term exposure to NOE has been associated with well-being and health benefits , reporting psycho-physiological benefits that include : positive mood[1–5 ] , improved attention[4,6 ] , increased self-esteem[1,2,6 ] , greater heart rate variability[2,3,5,7,8 ] , reduced heart rate[2,4,5,7 ] , and reduced blood pressure[2–7 ] ( these last two indicators considered benefits when their reduction implies a reversion of elevated rates to healthy levels ) .
Various mechanisms have been suggested to explain the association between NOE and health and well-being .
These include : increased opportunities for physical activity and social interaction , stress reduction and restorative effects , and reduced exposure to environmental pollutants , such as noise and air pollution[9,10 ] .
However , there is not yet a clear understanding of these mechanisms , which have rarely been studied together or in experimental studies[3,8,10–15 ] .
Apart from the lack of insight into mechanisms , there are other limitations in existing experimental studies .
A number of studies have used students[3,5,6 ] or used opportunistic sampling methods[1,3,5–8,15,16 ] , and many have only included participants of one sex[3,5,8 ] , which limits their external validity .
Also , the existing studies are frequently highly controlled experiments[2–7,15,16 ] , focusing on the associations after induced stress[2,8 ] , and using laboratory settings[2,7,8 ] .
Therefore , ecological validity of existing experimental evidence is likely to be low .
Other limitations in the existing literature include the fact that the effects of NOE in populations with some psycho-physiological affection .
have rarely been studied , with the exception of Barton et al. ( 2012 ) who studied the effects of exposure to NOE on people with mental health problems ( i.e. substance-related , psychotic , mood , or anxiety disorders ) and Sonntag-Öström et al. ( 2014 ) who studied exposure to NOE on people with exhaustion disorders .
Also , few studies have investigated the effects of long exposures[17–20 ] .
Finally , few have studied the effects of blue environments ( those that include water bodies ) , with the exception of a study that included a swimming pool[17 ] , one that included a waterside[1 ] , one that included a forest with a path leading to a stream[8 ] , one that included a forest next to a lake[4 ] , one that included a vegetated footpath besides a canal[16 ] and one that included seacoasts and estuaries[21 ] .
However , these investigating blue environments have indicated towards a psycho-physiological benefit of them .
We hypothesised that exposure to natural environments may promote psycho-physiological benefits on people with indications of psychological distress by increasing self-perceived restoration experience and social interactions , being these benefits bigger when the exposure is longer .
So , the aims of this study were to investigate : ( i ) the effects of unconstrained exposure to real natural and urban environments ( green , blue , and urban ) on psycho-physiological indicators on people with indications of psychological distress ; ( ii ) possible differential effects of 30 minutes and 30 + 180 minutes of exposure ; ( iii ) possible mechanisms explaining these effects .
BODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS.PARTICIPANTS : All the participants were individuals that had previously participated in a survey of 1000 people in Barcelona city as part of the PHENOTYPE project[11 ] .
As part of the survey , they had answered the Mental Health Inventory ( MHI-5 ) subscale from the SF-36 health questionnaire[22 ] .
The MHI-5 scores had been transformed into a scale from 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating better mental health .
So we purposively selected those individuals MHI-5 scored in the lower 50th percentile and who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria : ( i ) between 18–75 years old , ( ii ) no smokers , ( iii ) able to walk for 30 minutes at a self-directed pace , ( iv ) with no chest , abdomen surgery or heart attack during the last three months , ( v ) no retinal detachment or eyes surgery or hospitalized for heart problem during the last month , ( vi ) no under tuberculosis treatment , ( vii ) no respiratory infection during the last three weeks , ( viii ) no asthmatic or pregnant , ( ix ) neither having used inhaler nor taking medication different than usual during the 24 hours previous to any of the data collection days .
Taking into account sample sizes of similarly designed studies[2–4,7,8,12,14,15,17–19,23 ] and an initial sample size calculation ( power of 80 % and alpha level of 0.05 ) we determined that a sample size of 20–50 participants was needed .
Hypothesising that people with some psycho-physiological affection would have more marked changes , we pragmatically decided to sample between 25 and 30 participants .
Finally , only 26 participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria accepted to participate in the study .
The participants that accepted to participate were not different from the ones that either declined to participate or were not possible to contact ( S1 Table ) .
This study was not registered before enrolment of participants started because the National legislation ( Royal Decree 223/2004 ) only requires the registration of those clinical trials with drugs or interventional studies .
We considered this study neither of these two study designs , so it was regulated by the Biomedical Research Law 14/2007 and no registration as a clinical trial was needed .
However , the study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on December 2015 ( NCT02624921 ) .
And the authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered .
Ethical approval ( No.2012/4978/l from 18/01/2013 ) was obtained from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Municipal Health Care ( CEIC PS-MAR ) , Barcelona , Spain .
Each participant gave written informed consent and received € 150 for participation .
BODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS.DESIGN : Participants recruitment and data collection took place in Barcelona Metropolitan Area , in Catalonia , from October 2013 to January 2014 .
Catalonia is located in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula and has a typically Mediterranean climate , with mean temperatures of approximately 17 ° C in October and 7 ° C in January[24 ] .
Each participant was exposed to all three environments in groups of 2–6 people , always on weekdays , following a case-crossover design .
We randomly assigned each data collection day to one exposure environment .
Then , we grouped the data collection days so in each group there would be one exposure environment of each type , all the data collection days would be close but at least five days apart .
Then , we stuck to these exposure environments groups as much as possible , with the exception of participants schedules not allowing them to participate when assigned .
Each participant was assigned to one exposure environment group depending on participant availability .
So , the exposure order was randomised as much as possible .
No tests were performed during heavy ( continuous ) rain .
The protocol was the same for each day of data collection ( Fig 1 ) .
Participants were instructed to avoid caffeine on the sampling day .
10.1371/journal.pone.0172200.g001Fig 1Generic flow graph of sampling days .
T0 for Time 0 ( participants arrival ) , T1 for Time 1 ( start laboratory measurements ) , T2 for Time 2 ( transport to environment ) , T3 for Time 3 ( initial measurements in the environment ) , T4 for Time 4 ( first exposure , 30 minutes exposure ) , T5 for Time 5 ( measurements after 30 minutes exposure ) , T6 for Time 6 ( second exposure , 180 minutes exposure ) , T7 for Time 7 ( measurements after 180 minutes exposure ) , T8 for Time 8 ( transport to laboratory ) , T9 for Time 9 ( end laboratory measurements ) .
On the first sampling day , participants came to the study lab at 8:30 a.m. to fill in the consent form and an initial questionnaire .
The rest of the sampling days , participants came to the lab at 9 a.m. When in the lab ( Time 1 ) measurements were taken .
After , we transported participants all together in a passenger van to the exposure environment .
The transportation time ( Time 2 ) varied depending on traffic .
The one-way transportation time had a median length of 23 ( IQR = 21.5 , 35 ) minutes for the green , 25 ( 24 , 25 ) for the blue , and 19 ( 18 , 21 ) for the urban exposure environment .
Upon arrival at the exposure environment ( Time 3 ) , measurements were taken again .
After this , we instructed participants to spend 30 minutes in the environment and to come back to the measurements site after this 30 minutes period ( Time 4 ) .
This exposure was conceived as the short-term exposure , restricted by the time-lag between external events and cortisol changes ( 20–40 minutes ) .
After this 30-minute exposure period , we asked participants to sit down again and measurements were taken again ( Time 5 ) .
After all this , we instructed participants to spend 180 minutes in the environment ( Time 6 ) .
Also to eat the lunch provided whenever they wanted but always one hour prior to coming back to the measurements site .
This exposure was conceived as the mid-term exposure , restricted by the participation hours before their boredom or tireness and by the length of the research team working hours .
After this 180-minute exposure period , we asked participants to sit down again and measurements were taken again ( Time 7 ) .
After that , we transported participants back to the lab with the same vehicle .
The one-way transportation time had a length of 22.5 ( IQR = 21.5 , 26.5 ) for the green , 21 ( 20 , 22 ) for the blue , 17 ( 17 , 18 ) minutes for the urban exposure environment ( Time 8) .
In the lab ( Time 9 ) , we asked participants to sit down again and measurements were taken again .
Sampling days usually finished at 6 p.m. Before the exposure periods participants were instructed to behave as they usually would in that environment , avoiding only swimming , vigorous physical activity and eating ( other than the food provided and/or out of schedule ) .
Also , when asked , we indicated that staying as a group during the exposure period was their own decision .
It was not possible to blind neither participants nor those assessing the outcomes to the exposure .
BODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS.EXPOSURE ENVIRONMENTS : To enhance ecological validity , our study environments were those widely used by the population of Barcelona , that clearly represented urban , green ( NOE without water ) , or blue environments ( NOE with water ) , and that were similar driving distances from the research centre and parking areas .
The environments selected were all in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area including : city , natural park , and beach .
Urban- The Eixample neighborhood in Barcelona is characterized by a grid pattern with long straight streets and octagonal building blocks .
It is the most populated neighborhood of Barcelona , with around 16 % of Barcelona inhabitants living in it [ 25 ] .
Our measurements site was located at a square surrounded by busy urban streets ( coordinate system WGS 84 : 41.383340N , 2.150507 E ) ( S1 and S2 Figs ) .
Green-
The Collserola Natural Park is a mix forest close to Barcelona city .
It is dominated by aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis ) , and oaks ( Quercus ilex and Quercus cerrioides ) with dense forest floor .
Our measurements site was located close to a picnic area ( coordinate system WGS 84 : 41.393249 N , 2.091894 E ) ( S1 and S3 Figs ) .
Blue — The Castelldefels beach is a river-dominated delta beach with light brown sand of around 100 m wide , with small patches of dune herbs .
At its edge , there is a promenade seafront of about 12 m with no vegetation .
At the edge of the promenade there are green areas , streets , and houses .
Our measurements site was located in the edge of the promenade ( coordinate system WGS 84 : 41.265319 N , 1.981937 E ) ( S1 and S4 Figs ) .
BODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS.MEASURES.PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICATORS : Mood was assessed using the Spanish short version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS)[26 ] at time 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 .
A Total Mood Disturbance ( TMD ) , which indicates negative mood , was obtained from the POMS[27 ] ( Supplemental material , S1 Appendix ) .
Internal consistency reliability of the POMS ranges from 0.84 to 0.95 and test-retest reliability coefficients range from 0.65 to 0.74[17 ] .
Attention capacity was assessed with the backwards digit-span task ( BDSP ) at time 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 .
Participants heard 14 different sequences from three to nine digits in length ( two of each ) and repeated them in backward order[28 ] .
The test was completed after two consecutively errors[29 ] .
A total score was obtained which comprised the total number of correct sequences recalled , regardless of digit length .
Test-retest reliability coefficients of the BDSP ranges from 0.65 to 0.83[30 ] .
Stress levels were assessed using salivary cortisol samples collected using Salivettes(Starstedt , Germany ) at time 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 .
Samples were analyzed in duplicate by Universidad del País Vasco through the standard procedure ELISA ( Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay ) .
Salivary cortisol was log-transformed for the analysis .
Salivary cortisol is considered to be a reliable and valid parameter of stress reaction in humans[3,12 ] .
Blood pressure ( systolic and diastolic ) measurements were taken using a Digital Blood pressure monitor ( Model M10-IT , OMRON Healthcare , UK ) at time 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 .
Measurements were taken in the left arm with a minimum of two measurements taken each time point[31 ] .
Heart rate measurements were recorded continuously with a 4-lead electrocardiogram Holter monitor ( Model Cardiolight , Gem-Med , Spain ) from time 1 to time 9 .
Raw data were sent to the Holter supplier ( Gem-Med ) for clinical analysis .
Five-minute periods were selected to represent each time point ( time 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ) .
The selection was done considering the fifteen minutes pre-blood pressure measurement ( where all the participants were in the same conditions ) and also considering the measurements accuracy .
Autonomous nervous system ( ANS ) functioning was assessed with heart rate variability ( HRV ) .
HRV measurements were recorded and processed through the same process as the detailed for heart rate .
The indicators obtained were : low frequency power ( LF ; 0.04–0.15Hz ) , high frequency power ( HF ; 0.15–0.40Hz ) , and the ratio between LF and HF ( LF : HF ) .
Further , more precise indicators were calculated as coefficients of component variance of LF- and HF ( CCV-LF and CCV-HF respectively ) .
They were calculated as the square root of low or high frequency power divided by the mean R-R interval[32,33 ] .
All the frequency-domain indicators were log-transformed for the analysis .
Parasympathetic nervous system functioning was derived from HF and CCV-HF .
While parasympathetic-sympathetic balance was derived from LF , LF : HF , CCV-LF , and CCV-LF : HF .
Absolute reliability , assessed as 95 % limits of random variation , is 0.30–3.32 for LF , 0.30–3.36 for HF , 0.28–3.53 for LF/HF .
While relative reliability , assessed as the interclass correlation coefficient ( 95 % confidence interval ) , is 0.79 ( 0.64–0.88 ) for LF , 0.86 ( 0.75–0.92 ) for HF , and 0.70 ( 0.50–0.84 ) for LF/HF [ 34 ] .
BODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS.MEASURES.MEDIATORS MEASURES : For environmental hazards , we assigned the same value of air pollution/noise to all the participants exposed the same day to the same environment .
The value was calculated as the mean value for each day of sampling .
Air pollution exposure was assessed measuring black carbon in the air using a Micro-Aethalometer ( Model AE51 , AethLabs , CA , USA ) .
Measurements were taken every minute from time 4 to 6 in each environment , on each sampling day .
Data was corrected applying a smoothing technique that uses the Savitzky — Golay filter .
Noise exposure was assessed measuring equivalent A-weighted decibels in the environment using a sonometer ( Model SC160 , CESVA , Spain ) .
Measurements were taken from time 4 to 6 in each environment , on each sampling day .
Physical activity was assessed using CalFit continuously from time 1 to time 9 .
CalFit is a smartphone-based application configured to collect data on physical activity and geographical location .
Total Metabolic Equivalent of Task ( MET ) , total percentage of time in ( i ) sedentary , ( ii ) light , ( iii ) moderate , and ( iv ) vigorous activities were derived .
With the information collected during time 4 we assigned indicators to time 5 , and with the information collected during time 6 we assigned indicators to time 7 .
Social interactions were assessed using self-developed questions at time 5 and 7 ( Supplemental Material , S2 Appendix ) .
Total ( i ) time spent with others and ( ii ) time spent enjoying talking were derived from these measures .
Self-perceived restoration experience was assessed using the six questions of the Restoration outcome scale (ROS)[35 ] at time 5 and 7 .
To be consistent with the other parts of the PHENOTYPE project , each question had five response categories ( Supplemental material , S3 Appendix ) .
We scored ROS summing up the answers to each question[35 ] ( Supplemental material , S3 Appendix ) .
Stress levels were assessed as detailed previously .
To determine stress changes , we calculated the slope between time point of interest ( either time 5 or 7 ) and time 1 (baseline)[36 ] .
BODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS.MEASURES.EXPLORATORY COVARIATES : Information on gender , age , education level , self-perceived general health , self-perceived stress ( measured with Perceived stress score that can range between 0 and 40 , with 40 indicating a high level of global perceived stress ) , and chronic illness ( yes/no ) was collected .
Also , on each sampling day , we collected information on self-reported medication intake ( yes/no ) and waking up time , and measured height and weight .
Body Mass Index ( BMI ) was derived from mean measured height and weight .
The difference between waking up time and the time of each measurement was used to calculate elapsed time .
Temperature , relative humidity , pressure and wind speed were measured using a weather station ( Model WMR200 , Oregon Scientific , OR , USA ) .
Measurements were taken more than once on each sampling day .
We assigned the same value of each weather indicator ( i.e. temperature/relative humidity/pressure/wind speed ) to all the participants exposed the same day to the same environment .
The value was calculated as the mean value for each day of sampling .
We also derived a variable to indicate the data collection order through the different environment visits ( i.e. sampling order ) and one indicating size of exposure group ( i.e. group size ) .
BODY.MATERIAL AND METHODS.STATISTICAL ANALYSES : We used multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models with random subject and random outcome baseline levels at time 1 to evaluate the impact of exposure environment on changes in each psycho-physiological indicator and the possible mediators .
We also included exposure environment , and time ( including time 5 and 7 ) as fixed effects .
In the adjusted models , we also included other covariates as fixed effects , after confirming that multicollinearity was minimal[37 ] .
Mediation and modification were evaluated using the Baron and Kenny approaches[38 ] .
BODY.RESULTS : Table 1 summarizes participant characteristics .
Our exposure environments presented very similar physical characteristics , induced similar stress changes and facilitated similar participants ' social interactions .
However , noise , air pollution , and total physical activity were higher in the urban environment , while restoration was lower in the urban and higher in the blue environment ( Table 2 ) .

Only small differences were found when using measures at time 1 or time 3 as baseline ( S4 and S5 Tables ) .
In the adjusted models , we found statistically significant lower salivary cortisol when the results after the 210-minute exposure were compared with those after the 30-minute exposure .
We found statistically significantly lower TMD , salivary cortisol and HF as a result of being in the green compared with the urban exposure environment , and statistically significantly lower TMD , LF : HF and CCV-LF : HF as a result of being in the blue compared with the urban exposure environment ( Table 3 ) .
No statistically significant interactions were found by age or gender .

For HF , time spent with did not show a statistically significant association when the model was adjusted for other covariates , and for that reason is not reported .
For TMD , both vigorous physical activity and self-perceived restoration experience showed statistically significant associations when introduced separately in the model .
For vigorous physical activity , neither green nor blue environments showed statistically significant associations with TMD .
For self-perceived restoration experience , green and blue environments showed statistically significant associations with TMD , and its coefficients were lower than in the previous adjusted models .
For LF : HF , air pollution showed a statistically significant association when introduced in the model .
When air pollution was introduced , blue environment showed a statistically significant association with LF : HF , but its coefficients being higher than in the previous adjusted model .
For CCV-LF : HF , both light physical activity and air pollution showed statistically significant associations when introduced separately in the model .
For light physical activity , blue environment did not show a statistically significant association with CCV-LF : HF .
For air pollution , blue environment showed a statistically significant association with CCV-LF : HF , but its coefficient being higher than in the previous adjusted model ( Table 4 ) .

BODY.DISCUSSION : This study found that individuals exposed to NOE had better mood , lower stress levels and higher parasympathetic nervous system dominance of the ANS in comparison to those exposed to urban environments .
The associations were partially mediated by physical activity , air pollution and self-perceived restoration experience .
There was no evidence that the associations between NOE and psycho-physiological indicators were modified by time , gender , or age .
Our findings on mood are in line with previous studies , that showed similar beneficial effects of green environments[3,4,19,21 ] .
Only four studies have reported such short-term effects for blue environments[1,4,16,21 ] .
Our results are in agreement with Sonntag-Öström et al. ( 2014 ) and Barton and Pretty ( 2010 ) but neither with Marselle et al. ( 2013 ) nor Gidlow et al. ( 2016 ) .
The first showed that most mood scales were rated higher when facing a lake ( i.e. forest by a lake ) compared to when in the city .
The second showed that the presence of water in an environment was associated to greater improvements in mood than when only green was present .
The Marselle et al. study did not find any association between coastal walks and mood , despite only 6 % of their sample performed walks close to the sea , what could deal into low statistical power to detect associations .
Similarly , Gidlow et al. did not find any effect of environment on mood changes .
Taking into account both our study and the previous research , in unconstrained conditions , both green and blue appear to have a beneficial effect on mood in people with indications of psychological distress .
Moreover , our findings of self-perceived restoration experience and physical activity being partial mediators of the association between exposure environments and mood are novel and have not been explored before .
Our observed lower stress levels in NOE are in line with those from previous studies[3,19 ] .
However , the only two paper studying the short-term effects of green-blue environments on stress levels found no association[8,16 ] .
Our results of beneficial blue environment effects on stress levels almost reached statistical significance .
Considering this , and that the only previous evidence involved a different type of NOE ( forest with a path leading to a stream , or vegetated footpath besides a canal ) , no strong conclusions can be drawn .
The unexpected association we found between the green environment and HF is likely to be noise because was not replicated when analyzing CCV-HF .
However , the beneficial association we found between the blue environment and LF : HF was replicated when using the more precise indicator CCV-LF : HF .
This suggests that the exposure to blue environments leads to the ANS being dominated by the parasympathetic nervous system .
These findings are in line with previous studies that showed an increase of parasympathetic activity indicators and/or a decrease of parasympathetic-sympathetic balance indicators when there was an exposure to green or green-blue environments[3,5,7 ] .
Taking into account both our study and the previous research , there are indications that NOE may facilitate physiological relaxation through the promotion of parasympathetic nervous system over the sympathetic nervous system .
Our findings of physical activity and air pollution as possible mediators of the association between exposure environments and ANS are weak and should be interpreted with caution , especially considering that this is novel within the existing literature .
The analysis showed that light physical activity increments decrease CCV-LF : HF functioning , as could be expected .
While the analysis showed that air pollution increments decrease CCV-LF : HF and LF : HF , contrary to what could be expected , suggesting collider bias due to mediator-outcome confounders not taken into account in the model [ 39 ] .
Our lack of association between exposure environments and other psycho-physiological indicators is consistent with some previous studies .
For example , Gladwell et al. ( 2012 ) showed that viewing images from nature did not statistically significantly altered mean heart rate nor blood pressure[7 ] .
While both Lee et al. ( 2011 ) and Sonntag-Öström et al. ( 2014 ) did find no differences in the blood pressure[4 ] .
However , our lack of associations are contrary to others .
For example , Hartig et al. ( 2003 ) showed that , when compared to the urban environment , in the natural environment the attention capacity improved and the blood pressure declined more [ 6 ] .
Lee et al. ( 2011 ) found lower heart rate values after the forest exposure[3 ] .
While Sonntag-Öström et al. ( 2014 ) found that all natural environments had statistically significantly lower heart rate than in the city , and that the diastolic blood pressure was statistically significantly lower in the forest environments than in the city[4 ] .
And Gidlow et al. found that green and blue environments were associated with more persistent changes in the cognitive function than urban environments[16 ] .
This could be due to our study being the first one in which the exposure involved unconstrained conditions , as Gladwell et al. ( 2012 ) used a 5-minutes session of images viewing , while Sonntag-Öström et al. ( 2014 ) , Tsunetsugu et al. ( 2013 ) and Gidlow et al. ( 2016 ) used real environments but with highly-controlled exposures[4,5 ] .
Our study found neither indications of association nor modification effects of time , with the exception of stress levels , which can be explained by the typical diurnal pattern of salivary cortisol .
Moreover , the lack of interactions between environmental exposure and time would suggest that , considering the outcomes we investigated , no additional benefits are gained from a 30-plus-180-minute compared with a 30-minute exposure .
However , it remains unknown if other time points or other psycho-physiological indicators would show statistically significant differences .
This study explored the effects of outdoor environments on psycho-physiological health indicators under unconstrained real conditions , so approximating the participants behaviour to their real-world behaviour , what increased the ecological validity of our study .
It is the first to evaluate those effects in a population with indications of psychological distress , separately for green and blue outdoor environments , and including an exploration of the possible mechanisms .
Other strengths of our study are the wide use of standardized and validated questionnaires and tests , and objective health measures .
Also , the random sampling and the inclusion of male and female participants , which increased our external validity .
Our sample size was modest , which limits our statistical power and , consequently , the strength of our conclusions .
However , our study informs about the effect size , so it can be considered in designing future studies .
Other limitations of this study are that that we were not able to recruit more people with indications of psychological distress .
( e.g. lower 20th percentile ) , and that we can not rule out self-selection bias of those with less indications of psychological distress .
Despite aiming to explore uncontrolled conditions , we can not rule out that the study itself influenced participants behaviour and perceptions .
For example , our design with exposure in groups of 2–6 people , despite we did not instruct interaction guidelines , could influence our participants behaviour ) .
Looking after time could have effects on participant 's health , for example on their stress levels .
The design of our study did not allow us to control for important parameters while measuring heart rate variability ( i.e. , posture or breathing rate ) , so we can not rule out measurement error in the indicator derived from HRV measures .
Similarly , despite we explored the possible effects of medication intake , we did not explore differential effects of different medications , so we can not exclude that some residual measurement error is affecting the results on salivary cortisol .
Also , despite we randomised the visit order as much as possible and we controlled for it in our analyses , our attention capacity results could still be biased by the learning effects characteristic of most case-crossover studies .
Finally , we chose autumn and the beginning of winter because it is the usual period for spending time outdoors on activities that our study design allowed ( e.g. , walking ) ; in late spring and summer , activities that our study design did not allow are more common ( e.g. , sunbathing or swimming ) .
BODY.CONCLUSIONS : This paper provides evidence that NOE affect mood and stress levels of people with indications of pyschological distress .
Also , that blue environments can affect the parasympathetic-sympathetic balance .
This paper also suggests that increased self-perceived restoration experience , increased physical activity , and decreased air pollution are likely to be mediators through which NOE improve psycho-physiological health indicators .
This study extends the existing evidence on the benefits of NOE for people 's health .
It also suggests NOE potential as a preventive medicine , specifically focusing on people with indications of psychological distress .
Our findings strengthen the existing evidence on the benefits of NOE for people 's health .
Future studies should try to replicate our findings with uncontrolled experimental study designs with bigger samples than our study .
Ideally , the future sample sizes should be enough to stratify the results by age , gender and socioeconomic status .
Moreover , it would be interesting if they could evaluate clinically diagnosed people , a greater variety of environments ( i.e. several types of green , blue , and urban environments ) to evaluate specific characteristics with psycho-physiological effects .
Also , if they could investigate several exposure lengths , repeated exposures to the same environments , and how long the psycho-physiological health effects are maintained .
The inclusion of individual experiences , beliefs and affinity with nature would also be interesting .
