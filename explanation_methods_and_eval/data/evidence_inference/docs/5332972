TITLE : Short-term effects of physiotherapy combining repetitive facilitation exercises and orthotic treatment in chronic post-stroke patients ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] This study investigated the short-term effects of a combination therapy consisting of repetitive facilitative exercises and orthotic treatment .
[ Subjects and Methods ]
The subjects were chronic post-stroke patients ( n=27 ; 24 males and 3 females ; 59.3 ± 12.4 years old ; duration after onset : 35.7 ± 28.9 months ) with limited mobility and motor function .
Each subject received combination therapy consisting of repetitive facilitative exercises for the hemiplegic lower limb and gait training with an ankle-foot orthosis for 4 weeks .
The Fugl-Meyer assessment of the lower extremity , the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set as a measure of motor performance , the Timed Up & Go test , and the 10-m walk test as a measure of functional ambulation were evaluated before and after the combination therapy intervention .
[ Results ] The findings of the Fugl-Meyer assessment , Stroke Impairment Assessment Set , Timed Up & Go test , and 10-m walk test significantly improved after the intervention .
Moreover , the results of the 10-m walk test at a fast speed reached the minimal detectible change threshold ( 0.13 m/s ) .
[ Conclusion ] Short-term physiotherapy combining repetitive facilitative exercises and orthotic treatment may be more effective than the conventional neurofacilitation therapy , to improve the lower-limb motor performance and functional ambulation of chronic post-stroke patients .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : The mobility of many stroke survivors is limited , and most identify walking as a top priority for rehabilitation1 ) .
One way to manage ambulatory difficulties is with an ankle-foot orthosis ( AFO ) or a foot-drop splint , which aims to stabilize the foot and ankle while weight-bearing and lift the toes while stepping1 ) .
In stroke rehabilitation , various approaches , including robotic assistance , strength training , and task-related/virtual reality techniques , have been shown to improve motor function2 ) .
The benefits of a high intensity stroke rehabilitation program are well established , and although no clear guidelines exist regarding the best levels of intensity in practice , the need for its incorporation into a therapy program is widely acknowledged2 ) .
Repetitive facilitative exercises ( RFE ) , which combine a high repetition rate and neurofacilitation , are a recently developed approach to rehabilitation of stroke-related limb impairment2,3,4,5 ) .
In the RFE program , therapists use muscle spindle stretching and skin-generated reflexes to assist the patient 's efforts to move an affected joint5 ) .
Previous studies have shown that an RFE program improved lower-limb motor performance ( Brunnstrom Recovery Stage , foot tapping , and lower-limb strength ) and the 10-m walk test in patients with brain damage3 ) .
An AFO is an assistive device to help stroke patients with hemiplegia walk and stand .
A properly prescribed AFO can improve gait performance and control abnormal kinematics arising from coordination deficits6 ) .
Gait training with an AFO has been also reported to improve gait speed and balance in post-stroke patients7 , 8) .
Therefore , we hypothesized that short-term physiotherapy combining RFE and orthotic treatment would improve both lower-extremity motor performance and functional ambulation .
The present study aimed to confirm the efficacy of a combination therapy consisting of RFE for the hemiplegic lower limb and gait training with AFO .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : The subjects consisted of 27 inpatients ( 24 males and 3 females ) diagnosed with cerebral hemorrhage ( 15 patients ) or cerebral infarction ( 12 patients ) .
The patients ' average age was 59.3 ± 12.4 years ( 33–73 years ) , the duration after onset was 35.7 ± 28.9 months ( 5–115 months ) , and Brunnstrom Stage medians and quartiles of the hemiplegic lower limb were Stage 4.0 and 4–4.5 ( stage 3–6 ) , respectively .
Eleven patients had right hemiplegia , and 16 patients had left hemiplegia .
Among the 27 study participants , one used a rigid AFO with a medial stainless steel upright9 ) , two used a posterior spring leaf10 ) , and 24 used a hinged AFO10 ) .
The inclusion criteria were as follows : age , 30–80 years ; hemiplegia of the lower limb ( Brunnstrom stage 3–6 ) ; ability to walk without assistance using a T-cane and/or AFO ; diagnosis of hemiplegia due to stroke ; morbidity period , 5 months or more ; ability to understand the purpose of the study and follow instructions , and agreement to participate in this study .
The exclusion criteria were as follows : onset of stroke , < 4 weeks previously ; abnormal gait prior to the onset of stroke ( such as joint disability or peripheral neuropathy ) ; any medical condition that limited the study design ( such as severe cardiopulmonary disease or severe sensory disturbance ) ; severe aphasia and dementia that made it impossible to follow verbal instructions ; and lesions on both sides of the cerebral hemisphere .
The procedures complied with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki , as revised in 2013 .
The study was conducted after obtaining approval from the ethics committee of the Tarumizu Chuo Hospital , and all participants provided written informed consent .
The subjects were enrolled in a before-after study .
Intervention was combination therapy consisting of RFE for the hemiplegic lower limb and gait training with AFO .
According to a previous study , all subjects underwent an RFE program consisting of 7 specific exercise patterns3 ) , which were used to elicit movement of the hip , knee , and ankle in a manner designed to minimize synergistic movements .
This technique involved the use of rapid passive stretching of the muscles in conjunction with tapping and rubbing the skin to assist in generating contractions of the targeted muscles5 ) .
Exercises were performed as two sets of 50 repetitions with a 1–2 minute rest period in between sets5 ) .
In addition , all patients underwent gait training with a self-made AFO .
This intervention was performed 40 minutes/day , 6 days/week for 4 weeks .
Outcomes were measured before intervention and after 4 weeks of intervention .
The outcome measures used to assess motor performance were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the lower extremity (FMA-LE)11 ) and the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS)12 ) .
Functional ambulation was assessed with a Timed Up & Go Test (TUG)13 ) and a 10-m walk test ( 10MWT ) .
To determine whether physiotherapy that combined RFE and orthotic treatment improved the lower-limb motor performance and functional ambulation , the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was performed , because the Shapiro-Wilk 's test showed that the data were not normally distributed .
The analysis was performed with the statistical analysis program SPSS Statistics for Windows version 22.0 ( IBM Corporation , Armonk , NY , USA ) with a significance level of α=0.05 .

BODY.DISCUSSION : In this study , short-term combination therapy consisting of RFE and orthotic treatment was conducted to improve the lower-limb motor performance and functional ambulation of chronic post-stroke patients .
There were statistically significant improvements in FMA-LE , SIAS , TUG , and 10MWT after the intervention .
Furthermore , the results of the 10MWT at a fast gait speed reached the minimal detectible change threshold ( 0.13 m/s)14 ) .
Recently , some systemic reviews of AFO have reported that gait training with AFO can improve walking ability and balance in people with stroke1 , 15 ) .
However , few studies have focused on the correlation between AFO and motor performance changes of the lower limb in post-stroke patients16,17,18 ) .
Changes seen in this study were more marked in the lower-limb motor performance , with a substantial clinically meaningful change in fast walking speed ( 0.13 m/s ) being achieved by all participants who completed the study protocol .
The results of this study show that short-term combination therapy consisting of RFE and gait training with AFO may enhance lower-limb motor function , thereby improving walking ability in patients with chronic stroke , which is beneficial for comprehensive stroke treatment .
Several studies suggested that RFE might promote functional recovery of hemiplegia and activities of daily living to a greater extent than conventional neurofacilitation therapy , using a randomized controlled design2,3,4,5 , 19 , 20 ) .
Especially , RFE with other interventions ( i.e. , neuromuscular electrical stimulation , direct application of vibratory stimulation repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation , and pharmacological treatments ) may be more effective than RFE only for the recovery of limb motor performance .
In the present study , patients who received RFE with gait training with AFO showed significant functional and ambulatory improvements .
This study had some limitations because it involved a small number of subjects , and its intervention period of four weeks was short .
In addition , this was not a randomized controlled trial , and the efficacy of RFE with orthotic treatment could not be compared ; therefore , it is difficult to generalize its results .
Further , this study could not exclude observer bias and subject bias because the same staff implemented assessment and training .
In conclusion , the differences in FMA-LE , SIAS , TUG , and 10MWT demonstrated that application of a short-term combination therapy consisting of RFE and orthotic treatment has beneficial therapeutic effects on improving functional ambulation and motor performance of the lower limb in chronic post-stroke patients .
