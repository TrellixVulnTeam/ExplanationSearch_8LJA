TITLE : The effects of pre-exercise vibration stimulation on the exercise-induced muscle damage ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] To investigate the effects of pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation on the pressure-pain threshold and muscle-fatigue-related metabolites of exercise-induced muscle damage .
[ Subjects and Methods ] Thirty healthy , adult male subjects were randomly assigned to the pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group , post-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group , or control group ( n=10 per group ) .
To investigate the effects of pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation , changes in the pressure-pain threshold ( lb ) , creatine kinase level ( U/L ) , and lactate dehydrogenase level ( U/L ) were measured and analyzed at baseline and at 24 hours , 48 hours , and 72 hours after exercise .
[ Results ]
The pressure-pain thresholds and concentrations of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase varied significantly in each group and during each measurement period .
There were interactions between the measurement periods and groups , and results of the post-hoc test showed that the pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group had the highest efficacy among the groups .
[ Conclusion ] Pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation is more effective than post-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation for preventing muscle damage .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Exercise-induced muscle damage ( EIMD ) is caused by eccentric contraction or excessive overload , which requires large changes in muscle length1 ) .
EIMD secretes the intracellular proteins of muscle cells such as creatine kinase ( CK ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , and myoglobin into the blood .
In addition , metabolites such as lactic acid and potassium are temporarily produced in the contracted muscle , which can cause fatigue , pain , and a decrease or loss in muscular performance and exercise regulation ability due to inappropriate blood and oxygen supply to the muscles2 , 3 ) .
Delayed onset muscle soreness is first felt 24 hours after exercise , and it peaks within 24–72 hours after exercise .
The soreness gradually decreases and disappears after 5–7 days3 ) .
Physical therapy interventions such as stretching4 ) , ultrasound treatment5 ) , and micro-current treatment6 ) are used to treat symptoms of EIMD .
Recently , vibration stimulation , which is a type of mechanical stimulation , has emerged as a new treatment method7 ) .
Lebedev and Peliakov have suggested the possibility that vibrations may elicit excitatory inflow through muscle spindle-motoneurons connections in the overall motoneuron inflow8 ) .
Koh et al. reported that a significant change in the pressure-pain threshold ( PPT ) was observed when 10 minutes of a 20-Hz vibration stimulus was applied after the onset of delayed muscle soreness9 ) .
Song et al. reported that a significant decrease in muscular pain was observed when 10 minutes of a 20-Hz vibration stimulus was applied on biceps with muscle damage for 4 days10 ) .
In addition , Kim reported that the levels of CK and LDH in the quadriceps and biceps femoris decreased in the group that received 1-minute long vibration stimulation at 30 Hz after exercise compared to the control group11 ) .
As shown in previous studies , the positive effects of vibration stimulation have mostly been investigated for improving the symptoms after EIMD .
However , there is a lack of studies on using pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation to prevent EIMD .
Therefore , the present study aimed to investigate the effects of local pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation for preventing muscle damage .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : All 30 participants in this study were healthy , male adults in their 20s with an average weight of 66.6 kg and an average height of 174.5 cm .
Participants were all right hand dominant with no recent or previous history of a neck disorder requiring medical intervention , and absent signs of physical dysfunction in a clinical examination of the neck .
Participants were excluded from the study if they reported any current shoulder disorders .
This study received approval from the Cheongju University 's Research and Ethics Committee .
All participants received verbal and written information about the study and signed a consent form .
Participants were randomly assigned to the pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group ( group I ) , post-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group ( group II ) , or non-intervention group ( control group ) ( n=10 per group ) .
The PPT and blood muscle-related fatigue metabolite levels were measured before EIMD .
These variables were measured again at 24 hours , 48 hours , and 72 hours after a vibration stimulus was applied in the same conditions used in the control group .
EIMD was measured by using weight equivalent to 60 % of one repetition maximum , which was lifted and lowered in the 0–135 ° range of motion of the elbow joint while participants ' bodies and shoulders were in a fixed position .
The weight-bearing arms were slowly lowered at the same pace ( 8 seconds according to a metronome ) , and an assistant helped lift them .
Five sets of 15 repetitions were performed with a 60-second break in between sets12 ) .
A 60-Hz vibrator ( AT-1000 , AT System , Seongnam-si , Korea ) was used to apply the vibration stimulus to the middle of the biceps muscle for 5 minutes during a relaxed state by the same therapist13 ) .
To determine the PPT before and after EIMD , we used a digital pressure algometer ( Algometer TM Commander , J-TECH Medical , Salt Lake City , UT , USA ) .
The measuring electrodes were vertically placed 5 , 9 , and 13 cm from the muscular body , and then force was applied .
The amount of applied pressure increased linearly , and participants were instructed to notify the therapist when they felt pain .
The amount of pressure exerted when pain was felt was measured .
The measurements were repeated three times , and an average value was calculated .
The measurement locations were clearly marked with an oil-based marker .
The measurements were assessed again at pre-exercise and at 24 hours , 48 hours , and 72 hours after vibration stimulation was applied .
High measurement values indicated a low PPT14 ) .
Participants ' blood samples were collected at pre-exercise and at 24 hours , 48 hours , and 72 hours after vibration stimulation was applied to determine the CK and LDH levels .
Blood samples were obtained after fasting , and participants were instructed to have their blood drawn at their designated time with an error margin of ± 1 hour10 ) .
Windows SPSS 18.0 ( SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) was used for data analysis , and one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was conducted to test for homogeneity .
Differences in the variables among each group were tested using repeated-measure ANOVA .
The Tukey method was used to perform the post-hoc test , and the statistical significance was set to p<0.05 .

BODY.DISCUSSION : Vibration stimulation is a treatment method that directly stimulates the human body and induces exercise-like effects on desired locations15 ) .
Bakhtiary et al.16 ) reported that vibration stimulation was very effective for muscle damage recovery , and it could be used in athletes and the public who require a fast recovery .
Aminian-Far reported that 5 minutes of pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation of the lower limbs significantly reduced the delayed muscle soreness-pain threshold in healthy adults compared to those in the control group17 ) .
In the present study , the pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group showed a relatively higher PPT than the other groups , which coincided with the results from previous studies .
Saijo et al.18 ) reported that vibration stimulation induced pain relief and topical anesthesia based on gate control theory .
Additionally , McHugh19 ) reported that vibration stimulation increased the activity and tension of the muscle , which helped prevent damage caused by injuries or contraction .
Therefore , it can be inferred that vibration stimulation of the muscle decreases muscle injuries , EIMD , and pain .
The CK and LDH levels are used as indicators of cell membrane damage , tissue necrosis , and muscle cell damage caused by high-intensity exercise .
In addition , CK and LDH are enzymes that aid in regulating the balance between catabolism and anabolism of carbohydrates , which means they represent energy metabolism20 , 21 ) .
Changes in the CK and LDH levels in the current study showed that the pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group displayed the lowest CK level , whereas LDH levels in the pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group and post-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation group were lower than those in the control group .
Bakhtiary et al.16 ) studied 25 non-athletes who ran on a treadmill after 50 Hz of vibration stimulation was applied to the lower limbs , and they reported that the CK level was relatively lower in the experimental group than in the control group .
Imtiyaz et al.7 ) conducted a study in which 5 minutes of 50 Hz of vibration stimulation was applied to healthy women after EIMD was induced ; they also reported that the CK and LDH levels were significantly reduced after 48 hours of stimulation .
Based on these results , we infer that vibration stimulation improved muscle recovery from fatigue by quickly removing lactic acid in the blood22 ) .
Hazell et al. reported that arterial pressure , blood flow , and the superficial skin temperature significantly increase around the location of vibration stimulation23 ) .
Similarly , Butterfield et al. reported that the increased blood flow improved permeability of the cell membrane and removed inflammatory agents such as prostaglandin , bradykinin , and histamine24 ) , which improved exercise-induced fatigue and muscle damage25 ) .
These results indicate that vibration stimulation on the biceps after EIMD affects the PPT and CK and LDH levels .
We determined that pre-induced muscle damage vibration stimulation is more effective than post-EIMD vibration stimulation for preventing muscle damage .
