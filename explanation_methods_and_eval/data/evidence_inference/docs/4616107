TITLE : Electrophysiological characteristics according to activity level of myofascial trigger points ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] This study compared the differences in electrophysiological characteristics of normal muscles versus muscles with latent or active myofascial trigger points , and identified the neuromuscular physiological characteristics of muscles with active myofascial trigger points , thereby providing a quantitative evaluation of myofascial pain syndrome and clinical foundational data for its diagnosis .
[ Subjects ] Ninety adults in their 20s participated in this study .
Subjects were equally divided into three groups : the active myofascial trigger point group , the latent myofascial trigger point group , and the control group .
[ Methods ] Maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) , endurance , median frequency ( MDF ) , and muscle fatigue index were measured in all subjects .
[ Results ] No significant differences in MVIC or endurance were revealed among the three groups .
However , the active trigger point group had significantly different MDF and muscle fatigue index compared with the control group .
[ Conclusion ]
Given that muscles with active myofascial trigger points had an increased MDF and suffered muscle fatigue more easily , increased recruitment of motor unit action potential of type II fibers was evident .
Therefore , electrophysiological analysis of these myofascial trigger points can be applied to evaluate the effect of physical therapy and provide a quantitative diagnosis of myofascial pain syndrome .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Myofascial pain syndrome ( MPS ) can be caused by frequent muscle or fascial stiffness as a result of prolonged tension and muscle fatigue due to repetitive stress of muscles or overuse of particular muscles1 , 2 ) .
Most individuals experience MPS at least once in their lifetime .
MPS activates trigger points in 54 % of women and 45 % of men , and is regarded as the most common cause of pain in the musculoskeletal system3 ) .
In particular , the upper trapezius requires head movement according to the direction of view , but it can be vulnerable to damage when the hands and arms are used repetitively in work that requires precise control4,5,6 ) .
Once myofascial trigger points are activated , changes in the structural characteristics and contraction function of the muscle will occur .
The most distinctive changes are taut bands , tender nodules , referred pain , local twitch response , muscle weakness , and restricted range of motion3 ) .
To evaluate the contraction function of skeletal muscle , various methods can be used .
Among them , surface electromyography ( EMG ) analyzes functional changes in muscle by measuring quantitative changes in motor unit action potential that is activated by muscle contraction7 , 8) .
Surface EMG is widely used in kinetic analysis to diagnose normal or abnormal function in muscles and nerves according to amplitude and frequency9 ) .
It has several advantages , as it is noninvasive and convenient , and can perform measurement even during dynamic motion10 , 11 ) .
Although a number of clinical reports on the pathologic mechanisms or clinical diagnosis and treatment of MPS can be found , few studies have been conducted on the changes in contraction function in myofascial trigger point areas or on the electrophysiological characteristics and neuromuscular physiological information .
This study aimed to compare the electrophysiological characteristics of normal muscles versus muscles with latent or active myofascial trigger points , and to identify their neuromuscular physiological characteristics , in order to provide a quantitative evaluation of MPS and clinical foundational data for its diagnosis .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Ninety adults in their 20s participated in this study .
This study was approved by the research agency , and all participants provided written informed consent .
Subjects were selected among those with no known neurologic disease , no regular exercise habit , and no drug use that could affect the experimental result .
Subjects were equally divided into three groups .
Subjects in the active myofascial trigger point group were those diagnosed with MPS by a physician and whose clinical characteristics were pain in the upper trapezius during rest , taut bands , tender nodules , referred pain , local twitch response , and muscle weakness .
Subjects in the latent myofascial trigger point group were those not diagnosed with MPS but who felt tenderness when the upper trapezius was stimulated .
Subjects in the control group had no voluntary pain or tenderness .
Mean age , height , and weight , respectively , were 23.27 ± 4.21 years , 172.32 ± 8.44 cm , and 64.14 ± 6.54 kg in the active trigger point group ; 23.74 ± 6.47 years , 174.76 ± 6.22 cm , and 66.74 ± 5.74 kg in the latent trigger point group ; and 24.17 ± 3.14 years , 171.21 ± 9.64 cm , and 63.44 ±
7.51 kg in the control group .
To measure maximum voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) , the shoulders and heads of the subjects were firmly fixed and pulled as the dynamometer as maximum power , thereby measuring MVIC against the upper trapezius .
Endurance time was measured from the start of MVIC to a 50 % reduction in contraction force .
Median frequency ( MDF ) was measured by using EMG at the muscle belly of the upper trapezius during MVIC .
Muscle fatigue index was calculated by obtaining the MDF at a section where the MVIC force was reduced from 100 % to 50 % , and remove the 50 % MDF from 100 % MDF was divided into 100 % MDF .
The sampling rate for the surface EMG signal was set at 1,000 Hz , and the frequency band filter was set at 20 to 450 Hz , using one channel .
Storage and analysis of the EMG signals was performed using Acqknowledge 3.8.1 ( Biopac Systems , Goleta , CA , USA ) .
The average of three measurements was calculated and used in the analyses ; 10 minutes of rest was given between measurements to prevent muscle fatigue .
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows ( SPSS , Inc. Chicago , IL , USA ) .
One-way analysis of variance was conducted to examine differences among groups with respect to the measured items , while the Tukey test was conducted for post hoc analysis .
The statistical significance level of α was set at 0.05 .
BODY.RESULTS : There were no significant differences in MVIC or endurance time among the three groups .
However , MDF was significantly different among all three groups ( p < 0.05 ) ( Table 1Table 1.Comparison of MVIC , ET , MDF , and FI among the three groupsGroup A ( n = 30)Group B ( n = 30)Group C ( n = 30)Post hocMVIC , kg19.8±11.5 * 22.1±9.423.5±10.2/ET , s48.5±9.749.5±10.251.2±8.8/MDF , Hz102.5±21.488.5±23.184.5±17.4†a < cMFI0.15±0.070.08±0.040.06±0.04†a < cData are presented as mean ± SD . *

Tukey post hoc results showed that the active myofascial trigger point group was significantly different from the control group .
BODY.DISCUSSION : This study aimed to measure MVIC , endurance , MDF , and muscle fatigue index of normal muscles versus muscles with latent or active myofascial trigger points , thereby identifying the neuromuscular physiological characteristics of muscles with active myofascial trigger points and providing clinical foundational data that are applicable for the quantitative evaluation and diagnosis of MPS .
Surface EMG , which was used to evaluate the functionality of trigger points in this study , is nonintrusive and convenient ; thus , it is widely used in studies on the functional characteristics of muscle , by analyzing the electrical activity of muscle .
The results of MDF according to surface EMG show changes in recruitment of fast-twitch muscle fibers and conduction velocity of motor unit action potential12 ) .
In addition , increases in MDF reflect recruitment of type II fibers , and muscle fatigue index can be analyzed according to the relationship between type II fibers and MDF13 , 14 ) .
In the present experiment , MDF was significantly higher in the active trigger point muscles than in normal muscles .
The above results indicate that as trigger points were activated , recruitment of motor unit action potential of type II fibers also increased .
In addition , muscle fatigue index also increased due to the increased distribution of type II fibers .
However , MVIC was lower in active trigger point muscles than in normal muscles .
Although a high correlation between muscle strength and MDF has been reported15 , 16 ) , the same correlation was not found in this study .
This result was due to increased recruitment of motor unit action potential of type II fibers in active trigger point muscles , which more easily induced muscle fatigue as a physiological phenomenon , thereby reducing muscle strength .
In other words , the greater the fatigue , the weaker the muscle strength17 ) ; endurance also was decreased due to muscle weakening .
Therefore , this study 's results will be effective in complementing the physical therapy diagnosis of MPS — which , until now , has focused on physical examination only — by understanding not only the usefulness of electrophysiological analysis in MPS diagnosis , but also the neuromuscular physiological characteristics of active trigger point muscles .
