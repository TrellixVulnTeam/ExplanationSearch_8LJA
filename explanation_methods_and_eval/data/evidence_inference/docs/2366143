TITLE : Randomized Trial of Antibiotics in Addition to Tocolytic Therapy to Treat Preterm Labor ABSTRACT : Objective : The objective of this study was to assess whether antibiotic therapy plus tocolysis given to women in preterm labor would prolong pregnancy compared with tocolysis alone .
Methods : A randomized , double-blind trial of intravenous mezlocillin and oral erythromycin therapy vs. placebo was used in addition to tocolysis among women in preterm labor â‰¤34 weeks gestation with intact membranes .
Amniocentesis was performed , and chorioamnionic membranes were examined histologically and cultured for microorganisms after delivery .
Results : Clinical characteristics including gestational age at enrollment , frequency of contractions , cervical Bishop 's score , and white blood cell count on admission were similar in the 2 groups .
Antibiotic therapy was well tolerated .
No significant differences in the interval to delivery , birth weight , and neonatal outcomes were observed between the 2 groups .
Women in the antibiotic group had a significantly lower incidence of postpartum infections compared with women in the placebo group .
Patients with evidence of upper genital tract infection in either group had a significantly shorter interval to delivery , lower gestational age at delivery , lower mean birth weight , and increased neonatal hospitalization time .
Conclusions : Lack of an antibiotic effect on the gestational age at delivery may be due to the low prevalence of upper genital tract infection among unselected women in preterm labor , to advanced preterm labor unresponsive to antibiotic therapy , or to an inability of antibiotics given alone to inhibit the cytokine response .
Further work is needed to identify markers of upper genital tract infection among women in preterm labor and to evaluate other potential therapeutic interventions .
