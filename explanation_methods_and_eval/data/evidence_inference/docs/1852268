TITLE : Ertapenem Once a Day Versus Piperacillin – Tazobactam Every 6 Hours for Treatment of Acute Pelvic Infections : A Prospective , Multicenter , Randomized , Double-Blind Study ABSTRACT : Objective : To compare ertapenem therapy with piperacillin – tazobactam therapy for the management of acute pelvic infections .
Methods : In a multicenter , double-blind study , 412 women with acute pelvic infection were assigned to one of two strata , namely obstetric/postpartum infection or gynecologic/postoperative infection , and were then randomized to ertapenem , 1 g once a day , or piperacillin – tazobactam , 3.375 g every 6 hours , both administered intravenously .
Results : In total , 163 patients in the ertapenem group and 153 patients in the piperacillin – tazobactam group were clinically evaluable .
The median duration of therapy was 4.0 days in both treatment groups .
The most common single pathogen was Escherichia coli .
At the primary efficacy endpoint 2–4 weeks post therapy , 93.9 % of patients who received ertapenem and 91.5 % of those who received piperacillin – tazobactam were cured ( 95 % confidence interval for the difference , adjusting for strata , –4 % to 8.8 % ) , indicating that cure rates for both treatment groups were equivalent .
Cure rates for both treatment groups were also similar when compared by stratum and severity of infection .
The frequency and severity of drug-related adverse events were generally similar in both groups .
Conclusions : In this study , ertapenem was as effective as piperacillin – tazobactam for the treatment of acute pelvic infection , was generally well tolerated , and had an overall safety profile similar to that of piperacillin – tazobactam .
