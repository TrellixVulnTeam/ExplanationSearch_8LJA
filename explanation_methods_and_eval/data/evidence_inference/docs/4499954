TITLE : Effect of caregiver education on pulmonary rehabilitation , respiratory muscle strength and dyspnea in lung cancer patients ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ]
This study evaluated the effects of caregiver education on pulmonary rehabilitation of patients who have undergone lung resection for cancer .
[ Subjects ] Patients were divided into experimental ( n = 22 ) and control ( n = 19 ) groups .
[ Methods ]
The caregivers of the experimental group patients received education on pulmonary rehabilitation , while the control group patients received general management advice for 4 weeks .
[ Results ] Pulmonary muscle strength ( maximum inspiratory pressure and maximum expiratory pressure ) was increased significantly in the experimental group compared to the control group .
Modified Borg scale scores were decreased significantly in the experimental vs. control group .
[ Conclusion ] Providing caregivers with education pertaining to pulmonary rehabilitation was associated with improved pulmonary function in lung cancer patients following lung resection .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Currently , complete surgical resection represents the only curative treatment for lung cancer1 ) .
However , the majority of lung cancer survivors who undergo lung resection experience pulmonary complications ; one-third of these patients report dyspnea , and one-fifth suffer from severely diminished pulmonary function , including respiratory muscle weakness2 ) .
Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy to decrease the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications3 ) .
However , patients may not be able to consistently engage in PR , for personal or economic reasons ( e.g. , lacking the funds to travel to rehabilitation centers)4 ) .
Therefore , there is a need for alternative methods , such as home-based PR , to maintain physical functioning in a more economical manner5 ) .
Previous studies have focused mainly on PR for patients or hospital workers .
Few studies have addressed PR education for caregivers , who typically facilitate home-based exercises during the outpatient period .
This study evaluated the effects of caregiver education on PR ( i.e. , respiratory muscle strength and dyspnea ) in lung cancer patients following lung resection .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Patients scheduled for lung resection at the Department of Thoracic Surgery of a national university hospital , between March 2013 and November 2013 , whose caregivers had not previously received education pertaining to PR , were selected for the study .
A total of 50 patients agreed to participate following an explanation of the study procedure , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants .
Ethics approval was obtained from the Inje University Faculty of Health Science Human Ethics Committee .
The subjects were randomly assigned to experimental ( n = 25 ) and control ( n = 25 ) groups the day before surgery .
Of these , 3 and 6 subjects dropped out of the experimental and control groups , respectively , during the 4-week study period , due to violation of the exclusion criteria .
Therefore , the final experimental and control groups were comprised of 22 and 19 subjects , respectively .
The subjects ' mean age was 60.22±10.89 years ; their mean height was 163.01 ± 8.77 cm , mean weight was 61.39±11.35 kg , and average BMI was 23.01±3.34 .
They were evaluated 2 weeks ( baseline ) and 6 weeks after surgery .
Caregiver education on PR included guidance pertaining to splinted coughing , airway clearance and breathing , and stretching and strengthening exercises .
The control group received general advice from the Department of Thoracic Surgery ( once per week for 30 minutes ) pertaining to pain management , postoperative care , use of an incentive spirometer and nebulizer , and mobilization of the upper limbs and trunk .
In the case of subjects who were not able to visit the hospital , a nurse telephoned them weekly to provide encouragement and clarification as necessary .
Respiratory muscle strength was assessed using a MicroRPM device ( Micro Medical Ltd. , Cambridge , UK ) .
Maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) and maximum expiratory pressure ( MEP ) were measured using the method described by Black & Hyatt6 ) , and these served as indices of inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength .
Dyspnea was evaluated using the modified Borg scale , ranging between 0 ( no dyspnea ) and 10 ( most severe dyspnea ) .
Data were analyzed using the SPSS for Windows software package ( ver .
12.0 ; SPSS , Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
P<0.05 was set as indication of statistical significance .
Data pertaining to the general characteristics of subjects are provided as means ± SE , with intergroup homogeneity assessed using χ2 and independent t-tests .
Group differences in scores before the experiment , and 2 weeks ( baseline ) and 6 weeks after surgery , were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance .
BODY.RESULTS : MIP , MEP and modified Borg scale values were more significantly improved in the experimental group compared to the control group , but there were no group differences ( p<0.05 , Table 1Table 1.Comparison of respiratory muscle strength and dyspneaMean± SDControlExperimentalMIP (cmH2O)Baseline62.5±21.463.8±18.24 weeks68.0±21.271.5±19.0*MEP (cmH2O)Baseline62.42±24.361.6±15.64 weeks66.5±32.571.2±16.8*MBorgBaseline3.08±1.162.45±1.464 weeks2.63±1.611.77±1.40**p<0.05 ) .
BODY.DISCUSSION : Refai et al.7 ) reported an association between respiratory muscle weakness after lung resection and increased incidence of pulmonary complications .
Recovery of respiratory muscle function after surgery is important because lung resection leads to impairments in these muscles .
Nomori et al.8 ) reported a 4.3 % increase in MIP , and 6.4 % increase in MEP , 2‒12 weeks after surgery .
These data are consistent with our finding that MIP and MEP increased between weeks 2‒6 in the control ( 8 % and 6 % , respectively ) and experimental ( 12 % and 15 % , respectively ) groups .
However , these group differences were not significant .
Previous studies demonstrated that smaller lung resection areas are associated with greater differences in respiratory muscle strength before and after surgery8 , 9 ) .
We speculate that respiratory muscle strength did not differ significantly among our groups because all subjects had undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery , which requires a minimal incision in the respiratory muscles interacting with the chest wall .
Dyspnea caused by lung resection is an important determinant of patients ' quality of life10 ) .
Our study commenced 2 weeks after the surgery ; the experimental group was characterized by a decrease in dyspnea over time , but this decrease was not significant compared to the control group .
Differences between our results and those of this previous study may be due to the use of indirect and direct interventions , respectively .
In conclusion , our data suggest that caregiver education on PR can improve respiratory muscle strength and dyspnea .
