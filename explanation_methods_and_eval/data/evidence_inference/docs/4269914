TITLE : Supplementation with Silk Amino Acids improves physiological parameters defining stamina in elite fin-swimmers ABSTRACT.BACKGROUND : Previous animal study has shown that supplementation with silk amino acid hydrolysate ( SAA ) increases stamina in mice .
The presented study was the first formal evaluation of the influence of SAA supplementation on parameters defining physiological fitness level in humans .
ABSTRACT.METHODS : It was a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design on elite male fin-swimmers .
The experimental group was supplemented with 500 mg of SAA per kg of body mass , dissolved in 250 ml of a Carborade Drink ® ; the control group with Carborade Drink ® alone ; 3 times a day , 30 minutes prior to the training session .
ABSTRACT.RESULTS : Changes discerned in the experimental group were more pronounced than those observed in the control group .
For example , the change in the serum lactic acid concentration observed in the experimental group was sevenfold less than in the control group [ 21.8 vs. -3.7 L% for the control and experimental groups , respectively ] .
An analysis of a lactate profile as a function of a maximal swimming velocity exposed a statistically significant positive shift in the swimming velocity of 0.05 m/s , at the lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L in the experimental group .
There was also a positive , although statistically insignificant , increase of 2.6 L% in serum testosterone levels in the experimental group .
ABSTRACT.CONCLUSIONS : This study showed that a 12-day SAA supplementation combined with an extensive and rigorous training schedule was sufficient to increase an aerobic stamina .
However , this phenomenon was associated with an augmented level of muscular damage ( an increased level of creatine phosphokinase in the experimental group ) .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : A shorter running time , a longer jump , or a longer distance run during a specific time , are results of not only a rigorous training regime but also of an increase of understanding of human physiology combined with modern nutritional techniques .
Recently , a hydrolysate of silk amino acids ( SAA ) from silk of silkworms ( Bombyx mori ) comprising of peptides of a length of 18 to 19 amino acids , has become very popular among people performing leisure and competition sports .
According to a variety of findings employing animal models , SAA exerts a vista of physiological actions including , among others , anti-diabetic [ 1 ] , anti-oxidant [ 2 ] , and anti-tumor [ 3 ] properties .
One study had even shown that SAA may also influence levels of blood triglycerides [ 4 ] .
Although some study indicated that branched-chain amino acids ( BCAA ) supplementation ( 300 mg/kg of body mas/day ) may enhance exercise capacity [ 5 ] recent studies on an animal model , performed by South Korean scientists , showed that high doses of SAA , i.e. , 800 mg/kg of body-mass [ 6 ] or 500 mg/kg [ 7 ] also enhance stamina .
The latter also shows a clear augmentation of testosterone production .
Although , as stated above , SAA and BCAA evoke similar physiological response , i.e. , enhancement of exercise capacity , the obvious differences in their amino acid compositions – BCAA comprises of Leu , Ile , and Val whereas SAA : Ala , Gly , Ser , Val , and Thr - enforces , most probably , different modes of their metabolic action .
It is known that BCAAs are mainly oxidized in skeletal muscle and that exercises promote oxidation of BCAA [ 8 ] .
The mode of action of SAA is currently not established , although there are some indications that its oxidation will occur mainly in liver and the main amino acid , playing the paramount role in its physiological function , is L-alanine -through its conversion to beta-alanine [ 9 ] .
Since SAA is already on shelves of many sport nutrition shops , we undertook the task of verifying its stamina-enhancing viability on a human model .
The presented study was a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design on male competitive fin-swimmers .
BODY.METHODS.ETHICS : All procedures used in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the regional medical chamber .
A written consent was obtained in writing from participants and/or guardians of participants under the age of 18 years .
BODY.METHODS.STUDY SUBJECTS : We conducted a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design of competitive male fin-swimmers .
All participants were recruited from the national fin-swimmer team .
Both samples ' size was eight ( i.e. , the control and the experimental sample ) , and the age means and standard deviations were 17.6 ± 3.78 and 20.71 ± 4.82 , respectively .
BODY.METHODS.TRAINING PROGRAM : The training camp , during which the experiment was performed , was a microcycle lasting 12 days and comprising three training units daily : ( 1 ) 7:00–9:30 am swimming , ( 2 ) 11:00–1:00 pm walking and/or running , every other day stretching , and ( 3 ) 3:00–5:00 pm swimming .
Within this microcycle , each of the competitors performed 30 training units constituting of total 65training hours .
Each of the subjects swam , on average , 7 km per day .
BODY.METHODS.SUPPLEMENTATION : All the required supplements were bought directly from a distributor ( Fitness Authority ® , http://www.fanutrition.pl/en ) without an indication of the purpose of the purchase .
According to the producer , the supplement contained 85.95 g of SAA ( alanine , glycine , serine , valine , and threonine ) per 100 g of dry mass .
A required daily amount of SAA , comprising total of 500 mg SAA per kg of body mass , was dissolved in 250 ml of a Carborade Drink ® containing 6.3 g of carbohydrates , 0.046 g of sodium , 2.4 mg of niacin , 1.8 mg Vitamin E , 0.9 g pantothenic acid , 0.21 g Vitamin B6 , and 7.5 μg of Biotin per 750 ml .
A respective nutrition , i.e. , a mixture of SAA and Carborade Drink ® , and Carborade Drink ® alone was served through a straw in lidded cups to both the experimental and the control groups three times a day30 minutes before each training session [ 10 ] .
It has to be stressed that all drinks were prepared by a person who did not have an access to competitors .
During the study , we also monitored the total calories , proteins , carbohydrates , and lipids consumed by the control and the experimental groups , stratified into breakfast , lunch , and supper .
BODY.METHODS.DATA ACQUISITION : A fasting blood draw was completed to measure the following parameters : ( 1 ) creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) , ( 2 ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AS ) , ( 3 ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , ( 4 ) lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , ( 5 ) serum creatinine ( SCr ) , ( 6 ) lactic acid ( LH ) , ( 7 ) serum glucose ( Gluc ) , ( 8) total blood protein ( TBP ) , ( 9 ) corticosterone ( C ) , ( 10 ) testosterone ( T ) , and ( 11 ) blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) .
All laboratory analyses were performed using the ARCHITECT ci8200 Integrated System , Abbott Diagnostic .
BODY.METHODS.LACTATE PROFILING PROTOCOL : The incremental 7 × 200 m step test was used to provide objective information on the aerobic fitness of a swimmer .
All testing was conducted in a 50 m pool .
Individualized target times , based on the personal best time for each swimmer , were calculated before each test .
The final swim was set to be for maximum effort .
The time for each 100 m split and the total 200 m was recorded manually .
After completion of each 200 m , heart rate was measured with a Polar Sports Tester PE ( Polar Electro Oy , Kempele , Finland ) and a 25 mL capillary blood sample was taken from the earlobe or finger tip and analyzed for lactate concentration using the Accusport Blood Lactate Meter ( Boehringer Mannheim , Germany ) .
Lactate tolerance was assessed graphically on a plot of swimming velocity ( swimming pace , m/s over the distance of 200 m ) versus lactate concentration .
BODY.METHODS.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Changes induced by the training period in experimental and control groups were examined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test .
Differences between the groups were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test using the P-value of 0.05 as the statistical threshold .
Relative changes induced by the experiment were measured using the " natural " relative difference , employing the natural logarithm , which was denoted as log percent ( L% ) [ 11 ] : L% = 100 * ln ( after/before ) .

An analysis of changes induced by SAA supplementation in experimental and control groups revealed the lack of statistically significant changes .
However , the majority of changes observed in the experimental group are more pronounced than those observed in the control group .
A statistical comparison of the total calories , proteins , carbohydrates , and lipids consumed during the breakfast , lunch , and supper , revealed the lack of significant differences between the control and experimental group .
A concentration of serum lactic acid in the control group elevated ( 21.8 L% ) , and decreased ( −3.7 L% ) in experiment group .
Corticosterone concentration decreased in the control group ( −2.0 % L ) while in the experimental group , it increased ( 10.9 L% ) .
Analogous , although not so pronounced , a decrease of −6.1 L% and an increase of 2.6 L% of testosterone levels in the control and experimental groups was observed .
It has to be noted that in the previous study an increase of only 1.3 L% in mean testosterone levels after 44 days of exercise program was observed [ 7 ] .
An increase of 47.7 L% in the control group versus the lack of any changes in the experimental group was observed for ALT .
AST concentration increased in both groups , and an increase in the control group was more pronounced than in the experimental group .
There was also a substantial increase in serum creatine kinase levels in both control and experimental groups .
An analysis of a lactate profile , Figure 1A-B , as a function of a maximal swimming velocity , exposed a statistically significant positive shift of swimming velocity , at the reference of the lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L , between the experimental group and the control group .

BODY.CONCLUSIONS : A search for novel supplements , other than anabolic steroids , lead to founding of a well-prospering industry , providing amateur and professional sportsmen with a vista of nutrition increasing muscular gain and stamina .
Among them , SAA has become very popular due to their supposed positive influence on physical stamina .
Unfortunately , the popularity of this supplement is rendered rather by claims of a manufacturer and not lucid scientific reports on human models .
To address this shortcomings we performed this study , which is the first ever attempt to analyze an impact of SAA supplementation on physical stamina in humans .
Taking into account the current literature on translation of drugs dose from animal to human [ 12 ] , we primarily contemplated the use of ~41 mg of SAA per kg of body mass/day , not 500 mg/kg/day as presented in this study .
However , we did not consider SAA as drugs , per se , but only as a nutritional supplement .
Additionally a limited duration of an experiment i.e. , 12-day training regime , and demands of team coaches inclined us to employ a very high dose of SAA .
i.e. , 500 mg/kg body mass/day .
In this study , performed on a group of competitive male swimmers , we confirmed the earlier finding , that indicated SAA induced increase in physical stamina ; vide an increase of a maximal swimming velocity at the lactate threshold of 4 mmol/L [ 13,14 ] in the experimental group .
Although the previous study showed a positive influence of SAA supplementation on the elevation of testosterone levels on the 44th day program , in which mice were administered to a weight-loaded ( 5 % of body weight ) forced swimming , this study , i.e. , a 12-day SAA supplementation program combined with an extensive and rigorous training program , resulted only in an slight increase in serum testosterone levels .
There is a significant discrepancy regarding the levels of creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) , a marker of muscle damage , between this report and the previous one [ 7 ] .
Opposite to the animal model study , this analysis shows a perspicacious increase in CPK levels in the experimental group as compared to the control group ; a change of 36.7 L% in the former versus 89.9 L% in the latter .
This observation allows us to conjecture that SAA supplementation induces a higher stamina , but it does not prevent a muscular damage caused by an extensive training effort .
However , an analysis of the current literature indicated that supplementation with branched-chain amino acids and taurine-the supplement diminishing or preventing muscular damage caused by extensive training-may be the right direction for utilizing the whole potential of SAA supplementation [ 15 ] .
The weak point of this study is small sample size , which may be responsible for the lack of more pronounced changes induced by SAA supplementation .
Nevertheless , a comparison of our study 's data with those performed on an animal model [ 7 ] , where the study sample comprised only 10 animals , supported the practical viability of the obtained results .
