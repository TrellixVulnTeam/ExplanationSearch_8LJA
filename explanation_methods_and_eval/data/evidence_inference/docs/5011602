TITLE : Effect of intensive aerobic exercise on respiratory capacity and walking ability with chronic stroke patients : a randomized controlled pilot trial ABSTRACT : [ Purpose ] To investigate the effects of intensive aerobic exercise on respiratory capacity and walking ability in chronic stroke patients .
[ Subjects and Methods ]
The subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group ( n=6 ) or a control group ( n=6 ) .
Patients in the experimental group received intensive aerobic exercise for 30 minutes and traditional physical therapy once a day , five days a week , for four weeks .
The control group received aerobic exercise for 30 minutes and traditional physical therapy for 30 minutes a day , five days a week , for four weeks .
[ Results ] After the intervention , both groups showed significant improvements in the forced vital capacity , forced expiratory volume in one second , 10-meter walking test , and six-minute walking test over the baseline results .
The comparison of the two groups after the intervention revealed that the experimental group showed more significant improvements in the forced vital capacity , forced expiratory volume in one second , and six-minute walking test .
There was no significant difference in saturation pulse oximetry oxygen and 10-meter walking test between the groups .
[ Conclusion ]
The results of this study suggest that intensive aerobic exercise has a positive effect on respiratory capacity and walking endurance in patients with chronic stroke .
BODY.INTRODUCTION : Decreased respiratory is a well-established aftereffect of stroke and contributes to the limitation of independent life and activity in various countries1 ) .
Many stroke patients do not spontaneously recover to their respiratory function2 ) .
This reduction in respiratory function might affect the recovery level of patients with stroke , who have a greater need for aerobic capacity for walking endurance and other highly-intensive activities of daily living3 ) .
Reduced aerobic capacity and muscle weakness impede participation in every day physical and social activities , and impaired social communication further reduces quality of life4 ) .
However , many rehabilitation approaches to chronic stroke patients rarely concern the assessment and improvement of respiratory capacity5 ) .
Aerobic exercise has a positive effect on improving the cardiopulmonary endurance of patients with chronic stroke6 ) .
There has been a report indicating that the greatest benefits are achieved with high-intensity aerobic exercise , resulting in a more intense cardiorespiratory response7 ) .
In a systematic review , aerobic exercise was found to improve respiratory muscle strength and function in various diseases8 ) .
These results suggest that aerobic exercise can have a beneficial effect on respiratory muscle capacity in neurological conditions .
The same systematic review8 ) suggested that aerobic exercise could improve patient 's respiratory capacity and walking ability .
However , studies have rarely explored intensive aerobic exercise in chronic stroke patients in terms of aerobic capacity and walking ability .
Therefore , the aim of this study was to explore the effects of intensive aerobic exercise on respiratory capacity and walking ability of chronic stroke patients .
BODY.SUBJECTS AND METHODS : The subjects were 12 post-stroke individuals admitted to a rehabilitation center in the Republic of Korea .
The inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) history and clinical presentation ( hemiparesis ) of stroke ( first hemorrhage or infarction ) , ( 2 ) event occurring > six months previously , and ( 3 ) ability to walk a distance of 100 meters with or without assistance .
The exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) the presence of any comorbidity or disability other than stroke that would preclude study , and ( 2 ) any uncontrolled health condition for which exercise is contraindicated .
Participation in the study was voluntary , and the subjects fully understood the contents of this study .
An explanation of the study purpose and the experimental method and processes was provided to patients , and written consent from all of the subjects was obtained .
The study was approved by the institutional review board and followed the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki .
The participants were randomly assigned into an experimental group ( n=6 ) or control group ( n=6 ) .
The intervention was comprised of four weeks of inpatient treatment .
The randomization was performed by selection from opaque , closed envelopes containing the group assignment .
The participants of the experimental group received intensive aerobic exercise with an ergonomic cycle for 30 minutes a day , five times a week , for four weeks .
The intensity of the experimental group was 50–80 % of the maximal heart rate ( 11–14 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale ) 4 ) .
The participants of the control group received a self-selective intensity exercise with an ergonomic cycle for 30 minutes a day , five times a week , for four weeks .
In addition , all of the participants of this study received traditional physical therapy and occupational therapy .
A four-week training study was designed to evaluate the effect of intensive aerobic exercise on the respiratory capacity and walking ability of chronic stroke patients .
Follow-up was investigated four weeks after the experiment was completed .
The spirometer ( Sensormedics Vmax , Sensormedics , USA ) was used to assess the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) and the forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) .
The subject was instructed to sit , wear nose clip , and blow into the spirometer for as long as possible , and at least for six seconds .
At least three blows were required .
The FVC was the volume change of the lung between a full inspiration to total lung capacity and a maximal expiration to residual volume9 ) .
The FEV1 was the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started at the level of the total lung capacity9 ) .
A hand-held pulse oximeter ( MP110Plus , Mekic Co. , Korea ) was used to assess the saturation pulse oximetry oxygen ( SpO2 ) .
SpO2 stands for peripheral capillary oxygen saturation and estimation of the amount of oxygen in the blood .
This value is represented by a percentage .
Normal SpO2 values vary between 95 and 100%10 ) .
A walk test ( 10-meter walking test [ 10MWT ] ) was performed by having the patient walk 10 meter for the gait speed11 ) .
The participants were asked to walk three times and the average time was recorded .
The six-minute walking test ( 6MWT ) was used as an endurance test12 ) .
Walking capacity was monitored using a standardized protocol .
Distance walked ( meter ) was measured by the assessor .
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline data .
Category variables were compared between the groups using the Fisher 's exact test .
Between-group comparisons of baseline characteristics were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test .
Within-group comparisons of pre- and posttest values in each group were made using Wilcoxon signed rank test and between-group comparison for posttest values was performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test .
The significance level was p<0.05 .
BODY.RESULTS : All the participants completed the study .
There were no significant group differences in gender , paretic side , age , weight , height , time after stroke , age , FVC , FEV1 , SpO2 , 10MWT , and 6MWT before the intervention ( Table 1Table 1.General characteristics of the subjectsExperimental group(n=6)Control group(n=6)GenderMale/Female3/34/2Paretic side Right/Left3/34/2Age (years)56.8 ± 6.5a63.7 ± 5.8Weight (kg)66.3 ± 5.162.0 ± 6.2Height (cm)164.2 ± 8.4163.4 ± 11.7Duration (months)13.7 ± 1.514.3 ± 1.5aMean ± SD ) .

BODY.DISCUSSION : This study investigated the effect of intensive aerobic exercise on respiratory capacity and walking ability in patients with chronic stroke .
Both groups showed significant changes after the intervention , and the experimental group showed more significant changes than the control group in FVC , FEV1 , and 6MWT .
However , there was no significant change in SpO2 and 10MWT .
The findings of this study show that intensive aerobic exercise improved the respiratory capacity and waking endurance of chronic stroke patients .
Respiratory muscle strength and/or aerobic exercise in previous studies of stroke patients showed similar improvement in aerobic capacity5 , 8) .
Respiratory capacity depends on persistent cardiopulmonary organ and neuromuscular system interaction , and is crucial for stroke patients because of decreased physical condition .
In this study , the use of cycle ergometry for exercise may improve respiratory capacity and walking endurance in both groups .
However , the intensive aerobic exercise group showed more significant differences in respiratory capacity ( FVC and FEV1 ) and walking endurance ( 6MWT ) than the control group ( p<0.05 ) .
Decreased respiratory capacity may be induced through activity limitation and restriction of the social participation of stroke patients13 ) .
In a study by Sandberg et al.4 ) , the participants of the experimental group had improved their respiratory capacity , walking endurance , and balance ability .
The results of this study are similar to the above results .
In this study , the experimental group showed better improvement in the FVC , FEV1 , and 6MWT than the control group ( p<0.05 ) .
For independent life and social participation , respiration capacity and walking endurance are needed for patients with central nervous system damage .
In conclusion , this study explored the effect of intensive aerobic exercise on respiratory capacity and walking ability in chronic stroke patients using FVC , FEV1 , SpO2 , 10MWT , and 6MWT .
It revealed that intensive aerobic exercise positively affected the FVC , FEV1 , and 6MWT that are respiratory capacity and walking endurance measurement .
Thus , intensive aerobic exercise is effective for the improvement of respiratory capacity and walking endurance in chronic stroke patients .
